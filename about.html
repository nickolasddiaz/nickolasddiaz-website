        I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Information Assurance and Cyber Security at Florida Polytechnic University, with an expected graduation in Fall 2026. Driven by my passion for protecting information systems, I actively participate in online security challenges and training platforms such as Tryhackme.com and LetsDefend.io, honing my skills in penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and secure coding practices.<br><br>
        
        I have earned certifications including CompTIA CySA+, Security+ and A+, and I am proficient in tools like Wireshark, Splunk, Zeek, Nessus, OpenVAS, Sysmon, Volatility and Autopsy. Additionally, Iâ€™ve developed a python flask password manager and C++ text editor, demonstrating my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world security issues. My goal is to specialize in Application security, and Incident response, contributing to the safety and security of digital environments.
