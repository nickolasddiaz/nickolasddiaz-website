    <p>I am a cybersecurity professional in training with a focused interest in defensive security, aiming to secure systems against cyber threats. My career goals include becoming a Cybersecurity Engineer, where I would design, implement, and maintain robust security systems, or a Security Analyst, where I would monitor and investigate security incidents.

        Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Information Assurance and Cyber Security at Florida Polytechnic University, I have developed strong foundational skills in Python and C++, along with proficiency in Windows and Debian-based Linux operating systems. My understanding of networking concepts, including the OSI model and protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, and FTP, complements my knowledge of tools like Wireshark, Splunk, and Autopsy.
        
        I hold industry-recognized certifications, including CompTIA A+, Security+, and CySA+, which have equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of core cybersecurity principles and hands-on threat analysis skills.
        
        In addition to my coursework, I actively participate in my universityâ€™s Cybersecurity Club, where I engage in collaborative competitions and challenges designed to hone my practical skills in cyber defense.
         
        My technical projects include developing a password manager web application using Python's Flask framework and PostgreSQL database, where I utilized JWT and CSRF tokens for user authentication and explored common web vulnerabilities. I am also working on building a text editor in C++ using the Windows API, a project that has strengthened my knowledge of data structures and system-level programming.
        
        While I am still gaining professional experience, my background in competitive sports has instilled a strong sense of teamwork, discipline, and motivation, all of which I apply to my cybersecurity pursuits.
        
        I am committed to continuing my development in this field and look forward to contributing to the protection of computer systems against emerging cyber threats.</p>
