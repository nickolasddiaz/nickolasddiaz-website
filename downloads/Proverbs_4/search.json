["Diaz 1 Nickolas Diaz Mr Morphis Bible 12, Period 2 May 23, 2022 Proverbs 4 Proverbs 4 has a lot of bits of wisdom. It is mainly about wisdom. Sons and daughters should obey their father and mother because they have a lot more wisdom and because they were children before they were parents. Keep the commandments of God so that you get wisdom and understanding of God. Do not learn for the completion, learn for wisdom and knowledge. Wisdom will serve you more than knowledge. So seek it out and hoard it. Life is long so go in the way of wisdom and lead straight paths so you can grow and mature. Do not stray away from the instruction of God. So that when you do bigger and bigger things and have more responsibility you shall not stumble. Try your best to avoid the evildoers and do not travel with them. Evil doers will stumble and be punished by God while the righteous will be like the sun and be with God. Guard your heart or passion for God. Do not talk about corrupt things. Keep looking ahead and look at the bigger picture instead of looking in front of you. Control your thoughts and be firm in your ways of God. Do not turn away from God and keep your foot away from evil. "]
