["Diaz 1 Nickolas Diaz Mrs. Marano Sophomore English 25 September 2019 Why teens don’t read Questions. I don’t read as much as I was ten years old because when I was ten I had about half an hour of everyday. In tenth grade everyday usually I have have about two hours to a hour of homework plus I have soccer practice to three-thirdly to five o’clock then I have to leave my house at seven to get to school at eight. That is about four and a half hours of me doing school activities. Sometimes I have some time like on Wednesdays but I play on the iPad instead of reading because it is more fun to play than to read. I think there has been a drop off in reading because everyone likes playing with their computer more than reading. Kids, teens and some adults think that reading is boring. They also think its boring because they spend seven hours of school, five days a week which accounts to 35 hours a week. They think that they spend too much time reading. A good move the writers did is putting the stats on how people read less. This helps the reader to realize how people lost their desirer to read books. Another good point is that there are more ways to read like ebooks. Ebooks are easier to read because phones can hold thousands of books and ","the books are cheaper to purchase but kids are still reading less. An additional point is that parents have a role in kids not reading. Parents can do their part in kids not reading by giving them books and taking their computer away. "]
