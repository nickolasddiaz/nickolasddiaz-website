["Diaz 1 Nickolas Diaz Miss Brit British Literature, Period 1 May 12, 2022 Mr Keating the Hero In the movie Dead Poet’s Society Mr Keating does not deserve and did shouldn't be responsible for the suicide. Mr Keating is innocent and shouldn't be fired from his job. One reason for this is that he did not know that the boys were breaking the rules and hosting their own dead poets society. The only instance of Mr Keating influencing boys when they asked about the dead poets society and the teacher told him about it. The main reason he got fired, his unorthodox teaching of his class and making the boys interested in poetry. No one could have predicted the sucide and wanted anything close to it. Mr Keating in fact missed Neil the most. In the time that Mr Keating was teaching that class. The teacher made great friends with all of the boys. Mr Keating is probably the best teacher the boys had. Mr Keating in fact probably kept Neil from killing himself. It takes a lot of pain and suffering for a person to want to kill himself. He has been suffering all his life and always wanted to end his suffering for a long time. When Mr Keating was teaching it gave him courage to fully go for his dream of being an actor. To ultimately try to deny his parents' idea of him being a doctor. Once his parents completely denied him, he didn’t think he wanted to live as anything other than an actor and decided to kill himself. What makes the ending of the movie very saddening is that Neil's love of poetry ended as their teacher was leaving and their friendship disalved. In the end school treated the teacher like he was involved in the suicide but in reality he was the true hero inspireing everyone he taught about poetry. ","Diaz 2 The final scene of the movie, when Mr Keating got fired and was leaving. The students one by one stood up to say goodbye to their beloved teacher. Everyone said Oh, Captain, my Captain as a goodbye. The quote “Oh, Captain, my Captain” is a poem. It shows lots of significance to the story. The poem shows honor to the dead captain of a ship just like the boy’s sadness and grief when Neil killed himself. In the poem it tells of a ship where the crew had reached its destination and discovered treasure, only to realize that the captain is dead and cannot enjoy it with the crew and therefore ruins the excitement of the treasure. In the movie the same thing happens Neil kills himself and all of the enjoyment of poetry in the school is ruined. With Mr Keating gone, the poetry class is taught in the old boring textbook way. "]
