<span id="ta_1" class="t s1_1">reason for this is that he did not know that the boys were breaking the rules and hosting their </span>

<span id="tc_1" class="t s1_1">about the dead poets society and the teacher told him about it. The main reason he got fired, his </span>
<span id="td_1" class="t s1_1">unorthodox teaching of his class and making the boys interested in poetry. No one could have </span>

<span id="tl_1" class="t s1_1">him, he didn’t think he wanted to live as anything other than an actor and decided to kill himself. </span>
<span id="tm_1" class="t s1_1">What makes the ending of the movie very saddening is that Neil's love of poetry ended as their </span>
<span id="tn_1" class="t s1_1">teacher was leaving and their friendship disalved. In the end school treated the teacher like he </span>
