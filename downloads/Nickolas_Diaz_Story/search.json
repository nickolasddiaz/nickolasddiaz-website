["One hundred years before now. The world was covered with violent nations. Each nation was always at war ready to take back land, gain wealth or for revenge. But one day a powerful nomad necromancer was searching and found for the legendary cursed black diamond which grants immortality and an army of undead giants humans goblins. With this army the necromancer conquered half of the world because of the river of life which instantly kills any of the undead who dare to pass. Today the undead army wanders around the lands killing any trespassers. This half of the world is called the underworld and can be restored only if the black diamond is destroyed. Today three powerful monsters enhanced by the black diamond guard the gem, The Tongueslic, a powerful monster whose tongue is as sharp as a sword and is able to cut mountains. The Smelly is another monster who breathes green fire which fumes have a toxic/smelly smoke and lastly the Nanospider which is a million small spiders which combine into one powerful monster. Today the kingdoms of the world, the humans, the goblins and the elves are at peace. The story starts off at the human kingdom king Herald whose dream was to restore the underworld. Herald: I have sent the commander to scout out the area and to see how we can destroy the black diamond. Blade: I have returned to come to tell you about the underworld. Their forces are extremely powerful with thousands of skeletons, soldiers and the three guards monsters. I am afraid that we are nowhere near powerful enough to attack them. I’d say that we only have one fourth of their strength. There is no way we can win. Herald: We will never give up, we have to get the aid of the two kingdoms, the elves who are masters of magic and their master wizard “Baron ” and the goblins who are masters of building and their chief Bernard. Two years have passed of negotiations and training for the war against the underworld. The war has started and the plan is to destroy the army of skeletons with the armies of goblin tanks and turrets first and have the army of wizards be shielded by the goblins. While the human army of knights will surround the enemy with their speed and the generals Baron Blade and Bernard will have to kill the guards and destroy the diamond. When they got there the goblin Bernard fought and defeated the smelly with his robot suit and the wizard Herald also defeated the smelly with his advanced fireballs and Blade defeated the tongsling with his legendary sword. Because of the poison from the Smelly, Baron and Bernard have been knocked out. That leaves Blade to defeat the ","necromancer and destroy the diamond. The necro had many attacks, fireballs, thorns lighting and lastly earth attacks. Blade struggled to defeat the necro but eventually defeated it and destroyed the diamond, restoring the underworld. "]
