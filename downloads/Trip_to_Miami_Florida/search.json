["Trip to Miami Florida - Destination: Miami Florida - Cost: The flight for Sunday February 1 to Los Angeles to Miami would be 78 dollars and the flight back on February 2 would be 94 dollars. The rental car would cost 32 dollars a day and 73 dollars a day for the hotel. Everything adds up to 511 dollars. - Dates of the departure: The flight to Miami is at 11:00am to 6:40pm on February 1 and the flight back is 10:00am to 5:49pm February 7. - Weather: The best time to go to Miami is in February through May because the weather is warm. Day 1, February 1: I get up at 8:00 am to go to the 11:00am flight. At 9:00 I eat breakfast at Mcdonalds along the way to the Los Angeles airport. As expected I arrive at the airport at 10:00 and arrive in Miami at 6:40 pm. When I first arrive I walk to the Ez-rent a car, which is very close to the airport. Then I drive to the Western Premier Miami airport for a night. Day 2 When I woke up I went to the BalMoral restaurant to eat breakfast, then I went walking to visit the Bal Harbor Lighthouse and then I walked to the bal harbour beach to surfside beach for at least an hour and half. Next I went swimming at the beach. Since I am in the Atlantic ocean the water there is much warmer than the pacific ocean in California. Day 3 The next trip I would make is at the Art Deco Historic district, where it has many pastel buildings from the 1930s to the 40s. When I was in the district I ate my lunch at one of their restaurants and headed off to Vizcaya Museum, where it is a mansion from James Deering. The museum has great looking plants and the mansion is inspired by the Italians and French. Day 4 The next destination is Everglades National Park which is about a one hour drive from my hotel. When I went there I went on a tour guide with five people on the Anhinga Trail. On the ","walk I saw many swamplands and one alligator. After the walk was over I went on a boat ride which rode across the swamplands. Day 5 The next destination is the Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science. Where they have many aquariums, dinosaur exhibits, animal exhibits and lots of history exhibits. After the trip I will go to the Bayfront Park where they have a tower which casts out lazer allusions and a pepper fountain which can be controlled electronically. They also have a WWII memorial. Day 6 The next destination I went to is the Gold West Railroad Museum which is all about trains. They also have important trains which presidents rode in. Another museum that I went to was the Coral Castle Museum which has a statue made for 11,000 tons of coral rock and it is made by Edward Leedskalninand. Day 7 I pack up my bags and leave the hotel at 8:00 for the flight back to Los Angeles airport. Before I arrived at the airport I returned my car to the EZ-rent a car. As scheduled the plane leaves at 10:00am and arrives at 6:40pm. The reason why I picked Miami, Florida is because both of my parents used to live there and they are thinking of going back there to live. When they first arrived they were first refugees from Cuba. So they know a lot about this place and that is why I picked it for my city. "]
