["Diaz 1 Nickolas Diaz Miss Marano World Literature Period 3 4 November 2019 Analyzing the myth of Jason and the myth of Perseus Some Greek myths tend to have a hero like Achilles, Odysseus, Peruses, and Theseus and some of those heroes can be epic, tragic or nether. My heroes are going to be the myth of Perseus and Medusa and the myth of Jason and Medea. These myths can vary in heroic actions. Lastly the myths explain how the Greek’s viewed of the acts of heroism. In the myth of Jason and Medea, the story will explain the heroic actions of Jason and how the greeks viewed heroism and if Jason is epic, tragic, or nether. To begin Jason should be a tragic hero. On one side Jason lost two of his children and Glauce because of his tragic flaw of deception. On the other side Jason should be neutral because even though Glauce died, Jason got a political advantage because Medea left and therefore she cannot rule with Jason. Next Jason’s action isn't heroic because he tricked Medea to love him and betrayed her for Glauce. In the other way Jason’s actions are heroic because he risked his life that the sleeping potion works on the dragon. From my observations of the story the Greeks viewed acts of heroism as praising an army general for the victory even though the army ","did most of the work. Medea should be considered a hero while Jason should be considered one of the main characters. On one hand Medea can be the villain of the story because she killed Glauce and two of her children just for revenge. However on the other hand Medea did all the work, killing her brother, and Perlias. To sum it up, the story explained that Jason is a tragic hero, his actions aren’t heroic, and that Greeks viewed heroism as praising a general for the win even though the army did all the work. In the story of Perseus and Medusa, Perseus could be a epic, tragic, or nether hero and he can have a heroic or cowardly actions and it can explain how the Greeks viewed heroism. To start off, Perseus is an epic hero because he killed Medusa without dying but on the other way it is tragic because his own king Polydectes died. Next Perseus’s actions are heroic because he risked his life in going past the Gordons and killed Medusa. Despite him doing that, he isn’t heroic because he took the eye and tooth of the Gordons easily while they were switching it and when he got there Medusa was asleep and she was easy to kill. Lastly the greeks viewed heroism like a assassin risking their life to kill someone. On one hand Perseus was like an assassin because he was sent by Polydectes. On the other side there could be a chance that Medusa could be awake and Perseus would have to kill her without being silent. To end it all up, the story explained that Perseus is an epic hero and that his action’s are heroic, and that Greeks viewed heroism as an assassin. ","Greek heroes can be very different like the myth of Perseus and Medusa and the myth of Jason and Medea. Perseus is an epic hero and his actions are heroic while Jason is a tragic hero and his actions aren’t heroic. In the myth of Jason, Medea does all the work while Jason as the leader, he gets all the glory. The opposite happens in the myth of Perseus, Polydectes is the leader and he doesn’t get any glory while Perseus does the work and he gets the glory. "]
