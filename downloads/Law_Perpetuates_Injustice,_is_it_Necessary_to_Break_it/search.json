["Nickolas Diaz Mrs Karkut American Literature per 2 January 5 2021 Breaking a law without violence is a great way to start a change on an injustice law. If it is done in a way where it is very convincing and lots of people know about it, it could lead to a revolution where lots of people are encouraged to do the same thing and change the law. One famous example of this is where Rosa Parks refused to give her seat to a white man and broke the law, but she sparked a revolution where many people gave in to her cause and refused to ride in the buses. This forced the bus industry to abolish the law. Another way of changing an unjust law but without breaking a law is to run for a government position. Even if it is in a low level government position, it is possible to get people to act on an unjust law or to even change a law for the better. An example of this is my dad, he did just this. He ran for city council and won that position, now he is changing the laws for the better. "]
