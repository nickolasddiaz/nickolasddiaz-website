["Azusa Pacific University has many areas of interest to me. It offers a Christ-centered college, great athletics in soccer, and has a computer science major. Azusa Pacific’s history came from the great Azusa street revival-that in itself would be amazingly sufficient for a simple follower of Christ like myself who is awestruck by God's healing power. A spirit-filled school, carrying energetic people that would love you as compared to a large school with an audience of students you may never come to form any relationship with. The opportunity and profit you will receive in being taught in God's word. The kind of person you will be molded into with His word. Throughout my life in Christ, there were countless hardships and strengths. The Lord has also used two challenges to overcome. My challenges are migraine attacks, which affected me in my sophomore and senior year, and language disabilities from birth to right now. My belief in God has helped me overcome these struggles and helped me become a better person. My first strength is having a love of God, and for his word, the second and third are minor in comparison, but bring me great pleasure. They are soccer and computer sciences. These strengths are going to help me bless the college and learn from the college. Discovering my love of computer science developed and came during Covid. God gifted me with creating an exciting online video game that was downloaded 5,000 times on the first day. To this day, the game has come to bless 180,000 more to date and many fans created YouTube videos explaining how to play the game in different languages. Seeing this opened my eyes to computer science as a major and to see what else God would do for me with the college class offered. Classes on Public Communication and Professional Communication will help me work on my language disability and will provide me with a firm basis in journalistic writing techniques and improve my abilities to speak and write . ","My goal is to compete for a spot in Azusa Pacific’s soccer program as a center-back and have been playing since age 7 and am holding my own at an adult Div. One SWPL semi-pro level. A great opportunity to meet the coach is at the Exact Sports Camp on Nov 14th to showcase my skills and get evaluated. "]
