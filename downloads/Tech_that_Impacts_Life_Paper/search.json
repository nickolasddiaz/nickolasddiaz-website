["Diaz 1 Nickolas Diaz Kevin Knowles ENGL 100 3 September 2022 Eyewear in all What is the one technology that has had the most impact on my life? What is technology? Many people come to mind, such as advanced computers and spaceships. Although they may be right, it is not all the complex new things we have. Technology can be as simple as a tool, like a spoon. To me, it is anything that has helped improve doing anything and serves a purpose. For me, it has improved my life, with meals, transportation, phones, and computers. Some technologies are not good. Some technology can have positive and negative effects. Throughout my life, I had very poor vision. Because of this, I have used all kinds of eyewear, from glasses to contacts to everything that has helped me to see better. The very first time I went to the eye doctor was in Walmart eye center with my family. My brother gets his vision checked first and has perfect vision. Then I come and the doctor says I have poor vision, and I had to get glasses. On occasion, I was playing soccer and my parents encouraged me to get sporty glasses. They are often mistaken for goggles. I was in fifth grade and I never wanted to wear them, so I took them off whenever I could. This was at lunch, during breaks, PE and after school, soccer, and during the summer. I would only wear them in the classroom. Every year I would go to the eye doctor and get fresh glasses every year and waste a lot of money. It would have been a lot smarter to get one for many years. At the time I had some eye problems and hurts. I wore them until eighth grade when the same doctor told me about contacts. Yet warned said they were expensive. In the end, I ended up with them, and I had to train to wear them, ","Diaz 2 never getting good at wearing them. The doctor explained that I had three options: daily, weekly, or monthly contacts. I chose weekly as I had to wear them for a week and the doctor gave me a big box of contacts for a year. I have always felt them in my eyes. For two years my eyes were rejecting the contacts and with lots of pain. It always sucked me down. At some point, I stopped wearing one in my left eye, and in the seventh period of PE, I took the one-off. One negative aspect of removing 20/20 vision glasses is that everywhere that I look would be out of focus. Exactly how a camera loses focus and looks blurred, but permanent. Even if I go away from that place for a long time, my brain always knows. The only exception to this is my home, as I have always been there. Another annoyance/pain/blessing is that the 20/20 vision looks exactly like a brand new 4k TV. To me everything was too detailed, and it took me a long time to get used to it. In the summer of tenth grade, I never wore contacts again and went to a new high school, thus giving me a fresh start. I went to many eye doctors and said that I was not suitable to wear them anymore long after I made that conclusion. So it was back to wearing glasses. I decided the sporty glasses were very childish, and I ended up wearing normal glasses instead. On the first day of wearing them, I had a negative reaction to wearing them. My dad then convinced me to try them the next day, and the huge rejection was away. I still had lots of problems and eye pain when wearing glasses. So again, I went to at least four different doctor’s offices. Only one of them prescribed me eye drops, which helped to a degree but never fixed the problem. In my senior year soon right after I was eighteen, I went to three different places to get laser vision. At last I found a surgeon that had about thirty years of work, a person who was one of the best in the state. The surgery cost about five thousand dollars. After the surgeon cut my eye open, he used a laser to correct my eyesight and made me sleep for the entire day. The next day I could use my ","Diaz 3 eye but with shades on and some caution. My eyes today are a lot better, but I still have some eye pain. I also have been getting migraines for the past three years. It took me quite a while to figure out what was causing the migraine. It was corn and partly exercising. I often try to avoid foods that contain any amount of corn. When I get them, I usually wear migraine glasses to recover from them. Migraine glasses are dark-orange with some silver. I often wear shades, especially when I encounter bright lights. Eyewear seems to have a positive impact, allowing people to see in 20/20. But wearing glasses has negative consequences like lowering people’s esteem. They make them shyer, like a nerd, especially the sporty glasses looking like goggles. Wearing contacts and glasses can cause eye pain. Wearing them could be uncomfortable, because of the design of the glasses. Eyewear can be expensive. Normal glasses are around two hundred dollars. While contacts can be up to three to five hundred dollars per year. While laser vision costs from five to eight thousand dollars. I wished that I had better vision and had to deal with all the messes that I went through. "]
