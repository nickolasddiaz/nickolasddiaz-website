<span id="t3_2" class="t s1_2">never getting good at wearing them. The doctor explained that I had three options: daily, weekly, </span>
<span id="t4_2" class="t s1_2">or monthly contacts. I chose weekly as I had to wear them for a week and the doctor gave me a </span>
<span id="t5_2" class="t s1_2">big box of contacts for a year. I have always felt them in my eyes. For two years my eyes were </span>
<span id="t6_2" class="t s1_2">rejecting the contacts and with lots of pain. It always sucked me down. At some point, I stopped </span>
<span id="t7_2" class="t s1_2">wearing one in my left eye, and in the seventh period of PE, I took the one-off. One negative </span>
<span id="t8_2" class="t s1_2">aspect of removing 20/20 vision glasses is that everywhere that I look would be out of focus. </span>
<span id="t9_2" class="t s1_2">Exactly how a camera loses focus and looks blurred, but permanent. Even if I go away from that </span>
<span id="ta_2" class="t s1_2">place for a long time, my brain always knows. The only exception to this is my home, as I have </span>
<span id="tb_2" class="t s1_2">always been there. Another annoyance/pain/blessing is that the 20/20 vision looks exactly like a </span>
<span id="tc_2" class="t s1_2">brand new 4k TV. To me everything was too detailed, and it took me a long time to get used to </span>
<span id="td_2" class="t s1_2">it. </span>
<span id="te_2" class="t s1_2">In the summer of tenth grade, I never wore contacts again and went to a new high school, </span>
<span id="tf_2" class="t s1_2">thus giving me a fresh start. I went to many eye doctors and said that I was not suitable to wear </span>
<span id="tg_2" class="t s1_2">them anymore long after I made that conclusion. So it was back to wearing glasses. I decided the </span>
<span id="th_2" class="t s1_2">sporty glasses were very childish, and I ended up wearing normal glasses instead. On the first </span>
<span id="ti_2" class="t s1_2">day of wearing them, I had a negative reaction to wearing them. My dad then convinced me to </span>
<span id="tj_2" class="t s1_2">try them the next day, and the huge rejection was away. I still had lots of problems and eye pain </span>
<span id="tk_2" class="t s1_2">when wearing glasses. So again, I went to at least four different doctorâ€™s offices. Only one of </span>
<span id="tl_2" class="t s1_2">them prescribed me eye drops, which helped to a degree but never fixed the problem. In my </span>
<span id="tm_2" class="t s1_2">senior year soon right after I was eighteen, I went to three different places to get laser vision. At </span>
<span id="tn_2" class="t s1_2">last I found a surgeon that had about thirty years of work, a person who was one of the best in the </span>
<span id="to_2" class="t s1_2">state. The surgery cost about five thousand dollars. After the surgeon cut my eye open, he used a </span>
