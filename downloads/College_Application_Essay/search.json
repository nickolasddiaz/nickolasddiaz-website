["Nickolas Diaz British Literature Period, 2 September 25, 2021 Mis Britney On your marks, get ready, and then a bang and the runners start runaning! This is how all races start in track and field. My lane was number two and after the bang went off, my right foot jumped as my left foot jumped off of the starter block. Everyone started sprinting towards the finish line. During about ten seconds into the race, lane number two and three were ahead of everyone else in the race. In the last one-hundred meters of the race, the runner in the lane next to me strived to beat each other. We struggled to not give out because we were almost out of breath. In the last seconds of the race, he was behind me and first place was awarded to me. The referee said “Nickolas Diaz won the two-hundred meter race and got a time of 23.92.” and both of the teams cheered for my victory as all the runners was recovering and sitting on the floor because of how exhausted the race was but everyone was still overjoyed with happiness about the race and the race will always be remembered. Track and Field helped boost my self confidence. Before my Junior year, my self confidence was very low and had lots of anxiety and a lot of shyness. Running the one hundred and two hundred meters and winning many of them gave me lots of self confidence and removed some of my anxiety and shyness. Track also helped me improve and be a better soccer player by allowing me to run faster than anyone else. To conclude, track and field gave me many unforgettable memories and helped me improve as a person. "]
