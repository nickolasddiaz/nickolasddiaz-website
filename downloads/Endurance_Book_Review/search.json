["Diaz 1 Nickolas Diaz Miss Marano World Literature Period 3 12 November 2019 Endurance Book Review This book review is going to be about the book, Endurance Shackleton’s Incredible Voyage and the author is Alfred Lansing. This book review is going to have a summary, my opinion, a critical analysis of the author’s purpose and objective, and whether it was enjoyable. It will also have a comparison to another book and my review of of five stars. The book Endurance Shackleton’s Incredible Voyage is about Shackleton and his crew of twenty-nine people trying to cross the south pole on foot from west to east but their ship got stuck in the ice and sank, leaving them stranded. A long story short the entire crew went to elephant island and got rescued. In the beginning of the story Shackleton bought a ship called the Endurance for 6700 dollars and got his crew. On August 1 1914 the Endurance sailed out of East India Docks. On December 5 the ship left Grytviken whaling station on South Georgia Island with supplies. Two days later the ship passed the South Sandwich Islands and encountered some heavy pack ice until January 18 when they got stuck in ice. On October 27 1915 the crew abandoned the ship because the ship got crushed by the ice. Three days later the crew created a camp on the packed ice called Ocean ","Camp. The camp had tents and sleeping bags. The crew had to deal with very cold temperatures and blizzards. They also had to hunt penguins, seals, sea leopards, pigeons, terns, fulmars, silver-gray, petrels, and whales for food. One benefit of the Diaz 2 cold temperatures is that food can’t rot. On November 21 the Endurance sank from the pressures of the ice. On December 23 they left Ocean Camp and went on small boats to try to make it to land but they couldn’t do it because they were drifting too much so they had settle another ice patch. On January 1 they created a new camp called the Patience Camp. On April 6 the ice pack broke in half and the crew had to get on boats. On April 23 the crew landed on Elephant Island. However on the next day, the three men including Shackleton set sail to South Georgia to get rescued. However the other twenty-three people were stuck on Elephant Island. They couldn’t bring all of them because the all boats got destroyed but one boat survived and they could only fit three on. On May 10 the three people reached South Georgia Island. It is the same Island that the endurance got supplies two years ago on December 5. On the island, Shackleton went to Thoralf Sórlle who was the station foreman and got rescued along with the two other men. Shackleton failed three times with three ships to rescue the rest of the crew on Elephant Island but on the fourth try on August 30, he succeeded with the boat Yelcho. To conclude although Shackleton failed to cross the South pole on foot, he achieved something incredible, he survived on the south pole for five ","months. Even though no one died during the trip, one of the crew members got frostbite of their foot and it had to be amputated. Survival on the south pole is very hard, the crew had to fight through the cold, hunger being separated from their family, raw food, and even killing their own dogs for food. My review is about the book, Endurance Shackleton’s Incredible Voyage and the author is Alfred Lansing. The author’s intended audience is for the entire world because the world thought that the crew was lost, “he know that the Endurance had sailed there in 1914—and had undoubtedly been lost with all hands in the Waddell sea” (Lansing p.236). The author’s objective is to portray the story accurately, “Every effort has been made to portray the events exactly as they occurred and to record as accurately as possible the reactions of the men who lived them” (Lansing preface). The author’s success comes from the journals of the crew and the crew getting interviewed by the author, “ In addition to making these diaries available to me, almost all the surviving members of the expedition submitted to long hours, even days, of interviewing” (Lansing Preface). For my opinion the story had to be true because the author takes all the responsibility, “If any inaccuracies or misinterpretations have crept into this story, they are my own” (Lansing preface). A comparison to the Endurance and Fahrenheit 451 is that they both fight for survival. For the Endurance the crew have to survive the harsh cold climate. For Fahrenheit 451 Montag has to survive a car trying to run him over, “The driver of that car, seeing Montag down, ","instinctively considered the probability that running over a body at that speed might turn the car upside down and spill them out” (Bradbury p.122). For my review of the book, the book is engaging because has a lot of hazards and risks. I somewhat enjoyed it because it has plenty of adventures but it was very confusing to get the main picture. I would recommend it to anyone who like reading about adventures. The person for this book is my sister Natalie because she loves reading adventure books. I would rate this book 4.5 stars out of 5 because it was enjoyable but it was confusing to get the big picture. To come to an end my review states that Lansing’s objective is to be as true as possible and his success comes from the journals and the crew being interviewed and the book is true. It also states that the book Endurance and Fahrenheit 451 are connected through the fight to survive and the book is enjoyable but confusing. In conclusion the book Endurance is about a crew who survives being shipwrecked in the south pole. The author audience is for the world and he made the book by the crew’s journals and interviews his objective is portray the story accurately. One similarity between Fahrenheit 451 and endurance is that they both fight for survival. Lastly is that the book has lots of adventure but it is confusing to get the main idea.
