["Diaz 1 Nickolas Diaz Miss Marano World literature Period 3 February 20 2020 Is the American dream alive? There are two types of American dreams one with freedom and liberty and the other is poor people working hard and becoming rich. The American dream with the freedom and liberty is not alive because it is not given to everyone. The American dream with poor people woking hard and becoming rich is also only not alive. It is not alive because only a few people have achieved this dream one example is Scott Fitzgerald. He started off poor and then got rich by working hard by writing novels. The American dream with the freedom and liberties is not alive because not everyone in america can achieve it. The people who didn't achieve it is people who broke the law and went to jail or prison. Those people don’t get the freedom and liberties. There are people who get falsely accused and go to jail and loose out on the American dream so it isn’t alive. The American dream with poor people working hard and becoming rich is also not alive because not everyone can become rich. In fact only a very few people can achieve this dream. The American dream is whatever people want it to be. Most people define it as getting freedoms and liberties or poor people getting rich by ","working hard. The American dream with getting freedoms is not alive because people can be falsely accused and put in jail therefore loosing their freedoms. The American dream with getting rich is not alive because everyone can’t do that "]
