["Diaz 1 Nickolas Diaz Miss Marano World Literature Period 3 13 November 2019 Achieving your Goals Paper I don’t agree with part of the author’s central claim. For the part I agree with is about getting to a goal with pains and hardship and without enduring the pain and hardships, the goal will not actually come. Another thing I agree about is that everyone has the dream of being happy and having an easy life and not everyone is willing to endure the pain. The part that I disagree with is that working hard is the only thing needed to achieve a goal. In order to achieve a goal is to work smartly and diligently. For example if a student wants to get a good grade on a test, the student should work smartly and diligently by finding the best way they can learn and study for an hour. The passage that has my interest is the paragraph that with “because happiness requires struggle” In the passage, the author talks about the positive and negative side experience. If a person does nothing to achieve their goal then they will not get the positive experience of their goal and they will have a bad experience of regret. On the other way, if a person has a bad experience of hardship to get their goal then they will feel a positive experience. Ether way, the pain will be inevitable. ","A move that I think is interesting is when the author stated his own story about him giving up on his dream. It is interesting the author tells the reader that if a person doesn’t love their passion enough to work for it then they should quit. A successful person’s mindset should do the struggle first while the reward will be second while an unsuccessful person just thinks about the reward. "]
