["Diaz 1 Nickolas Diaz Mr. Morphis Bible 12 per 3 March 29, 2022 Testing of Your Faith, James 1:2-18 The passage of testing of your faith is about “how christains can learn to gain wisdom and increase their faith from God. The passage also has some wise sayings. To be more wise, be generous and donate what you have and do not regret or complain and God will give you more wisdom. Ask in faith and do not doubt God and do not expect to receive anything from God. The lowly in evil boast is their happiness. Do not care about being rich because they will die and not leave anything behind. The rich man will fade away with his riches and his pursuits. Blessed is the person who waits in trial or test of God and will receive the crown of God. God cannot be tempted by anything that is purely good and cannot do evil. Temptation is being lured by your own desire. If the desire turns into sin it will be easier for you to sin more and more and it will bring death. Do not be deceived by the temptations because every perfect and good gift is from God. God will be brought on through his own word or the bible. We should be a firstfruit of his creatures” ( Bible Gateway). The passage covers many topics, even if each topic is short, they all have great meaning and can guide you to be a better person. To start off, donating to the church can give you wisdom. Doing this allows us to be closer to God because it takes a lot of self control to give. God does not operate like a genie, he doesn't give you what you want, God only does things that will help you grow. If God was like a genie then chirstans would loose character and be more selfish. The lowly boast in their own happiness this means that the rich only focus on helping themselves and therefore have lots of time and money to satisfy themselves. Christans should not focus on the rich because they only know to accumulate wealth on earth which is temporary while christains focus of the permanent riches. God will give many tests in order to grow in maturity in Christ the more you do the right thing the more you will grow in character. God cannot be tempted, he can only do good, this is a very good fact to know and important to put faith on. Sin is a cycle the more you sin the easier to do the same sin again and go to the next step. This helps us to know how to combat against sin. God is the person who gives us gifts like being good at certain skills, progressing in these skills are a great way to show God. The bible is the best place to learn more about him and grow. Lastly we should take initiative and do the right thing first. This passage is for the newer christan generation who don’t know much about the bible and the religion. “The chirstian faith starts off small and over time when it is tested and tested and make the right decisions it grows and grows. The passage also talks about things that christains should avoid like the sin cycle and wishing God for selfish things and not focusing on riches on earth. The goal of chirstanity is to grow in faith and become very bold in Christ” (Jesuswalk). ","Diaz 2 Works Cited 1.
