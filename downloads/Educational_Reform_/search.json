["Diaz 1 Nickolas Diaz Miss Marano World Literature Period 3 March 5 2020 Educational Reform An educational reform that would be good for this school would be switching all the high school novels like the Great Gasby and Frankenstein to ebooks on the internet. A good reason to switch is that it is completely free for everyone because it is just a website. One example is a website for the Great Gatsby https://www.planetebook.com/free-ebooks/the-great-gatsby.pdf. This will make it easier for the students and the parents to afford the school. Another reason is that it doesnâ€™t waist any paper which is good for the environment. Lastly the ebook is more lighter and takes less space than a book. "]
