["Diaz 1 Nickolas Diaz Miss brokate 1 Period World History April 30 2020 Dear John Smith My name is Boris and I am a peasant farmer. I am writing to you to convince you that Communism is not as great as it appears. In Russia most people are poor. One reason is because Communism is weakening the economy. Today the inefficient bureaucratic mismanagement allowed most of Russia’s industries to collapse and most of the manufactured products are always in short supply. Communism does more care about the people. In fact it’s goal is to control every aspect of the people. Russia will do anything to get its goals. One example is when Stalin and Lenin did not want Christianity in their country. To get their way they they burned down thousands of churches and schools and killed many pastors and priests. Most people in Russia don’t have the freedom that capitalism has. The czar of Russia is cruel and got his power through violence. Stalin Used his influence to drive off the Trotsky who is the other contender for power from the government. He uses secret police to get his ways. He destroyed half of the homes in Russia to stop a rebellion. Many western leaders don't know how bad Communism is. The countries which switched to Communism will have a very weak economy ","and many of it’s people will be poorer and will loose all of there freedom. For me I struggle to feed my family. Sincerely, Boris "]
