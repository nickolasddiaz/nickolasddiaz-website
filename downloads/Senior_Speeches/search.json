["Nickolas Diaz Speech I would like to appreciate everyone who has helped me on my journey. I am very grateful for my parents for being so supportive throughout highschool. Especially to my mom as she helped me by driving me to school everyday. I would also like to thank my soccer coach and track coach Armondo and Mr Berney. I would also like to thank all of my classmates who encouraged me when I first joined Calvary three years ago. For the three years that I joined Calvary Chapel, I had many great enjoyable times however I did have many hardships. The best experience in high school was when I first joined the school and had ice-cream floats with my friends from the welcome new students event. I also had many great experiences in sports as I was in the top of the game in both soccer and track and field in 100 and 200 meters. My best moment I had from soccer is how my team won 1-0 from Santa Ana, which was the best team in our league last year. My best track moment is when I got my best time of 11 seconds in my 100 meter race when I ran at Santa ana. During the three years that I have been here I had many difficulties, one of them being covid, I lost out on a lot of soccer ability and lots of school. I have also struggled with a handful of classes, mainly Spanish 3 and chemistry, barely passing them. In the end I have learned a lot from all of my teachers and I plan to attend cypress college and transfer to fullerton college. "]
