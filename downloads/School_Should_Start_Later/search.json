["Diaz 1 Nickolas Diaz Miss Marano World literature Period 3 March 15 2020 Topics For Composing: Personal: School Should Start Later Calvary Chapel Christian School starts off early at eight o’clock, but I only see some of the problems that Lewis identifies. One of the problems that I agree with is that starting later would decrease the absent rate. For the school it is true, a lot of people are absent every morning. It is also true for me because I got a lot of migraines and they usually start at eight, when school starts. Maybe I would get less migraines if school started later. For the one hour delay would increase math test is partly true. It would only apply to first and second periods. For the rest of the day is not affected by that. For more sleep means less injuries isn’t true. I am in the soccer and track team. I barley see anyone get injured. Including myself I almost never get injured. For the drowsy driving by teenager, I don’t really know even though I drive, I have never been in an car accident or even seen anyone be in one. For increased risk for drug and alcohol use, depression and suicide, I really don’t know because I never did them and I have never seen anyone do them myself. "]
