["Clayton Haight, Matt Oca, Nickolas Diaz Mrs. Karkut American Literature Per. Two 16 November 2020 Constitution Paraphrase When it becomes necessary to end one political process due to lack of representation, it's only fair to list the reasons why. We abide by these facts to be transparent that all men are suppliers for their designer with necessary rights that are the desire to live and independence and peace of mind. That to protect these rights, governments are designed by and get their own powers from the people. And when any design of government begins to remove people’s freedoms, it’s the sole responsibility of the people to repair or replace it. Wisdom indeed will recite that governments' extensive tradition should not be altered for light and all knowledge that show mankind are more immune to face pain while wickedness endures suffering than to just themselves by putting an end to the original ways it once was. Looking at the King of England's record, it's clear England wants total control of our colonies, compromising our liberties. Here are our facts. He won't let us pass important laws we need now. He doesn't support laws for the people, preferring laws that make him and the British rich. He's refused to let us pass laws affecting large groups of people in our colonies unless they swore allegiance to him even though they’ve had the right to self govern, clearly showing he's a tyrant. He requests meetings of our representatives in far away cold, and strange places for the purpose of wearing them down into submission so they’ll agree with him. He's sent over crooks who he calls judges to dispense his will through courts without trial or jury. He's sent the Army to watch over us, when we didn't need or want them. He's done everything to make his army bigger than our system of law, and ","our ability to carry out justice. For breaking up our military so as to make them vulnerable, and controllable. For adding taxes without our consent. For taking away our right to trial by jury in many cases. For kidnapping our citizens only to be tried and convicted outside our colonies, and our own laws. So the representatives of the people living within these unified States of America gathered here under one roof declare to the supreme judge of the world we are free. We declare we are no longer under the British crown’s rule, and all political connections are hereby over. These Free and Independent States of America have full power to each build partnerships, do business, go to war, or negotiate peace. To show we mean what we say, we offer each other our lives, our fortunes, and our integrity. We are the members of the United States of America, and we are all gathered in the General Congress ,and we call upon the Supreme Judge, for the honesty of our goals, we are driven by the people of the states. We sincerely declared and publicized that all states have the right to be free and be independent and that they are free from the rule of the British. We are completely separated from the queen or king of England, the laws and from the land of Britain. We are free and independent states and we have the power to declare war, peace, make alliances, establish trade and to do all the things that independent states have the right to do. We support this declaration with the protection of our lands. We all voy to each other's lives, fortunes and our honor. "]
