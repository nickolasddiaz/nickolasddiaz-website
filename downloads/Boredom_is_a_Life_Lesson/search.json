["Diaz 1 Nickolas Diaz Miss Marano World Literature Period 3 15 January 2020 Boredom is a life lesson I don’t agree agree that it is especially important that kids get bored and be allowed to stay bored when they are young. In school kids always get bored especially in the more higher grades so there is no need to allow kids to be bored. Instead of making them bored they should be put in sports because the kid can learn life lessons, get fit and use electronics less. The only exception to not letting kids to get bored is kids who do homeschool because they have more time to spend on electronics. I partly agree with one the passages where the author talks about daydreaming when people get bored. The only way to daydream and get ideas is when people are bored and not doing a activity that requires some focus like listening to a teacher talk. Obviously people can’t daydream while doing an activity that requires focus like driving. If they daydream the person driving can loose focus. A move made by the author that is good is how the author ends and starts each paragraph. I usually use first, second, lastly, finally when I write a persuasive essay. The author goes over each reason, starts and ends off ","smoothly. I can apply this to my persuasive essays and make them a lot better. "]
