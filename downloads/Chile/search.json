["Diaz 1 Nickolas Diaz Miss Brokate World History Period 1 April 9 2020 Chile The country of Chile is a long narrow country. “It has a coast line of about 4000 mile but it is only 61 mile wide. About 5% of the population is native Mapuche and the rest of the population is a mixture of native and European roots. Chile has many animals like sea lions, penguins, pelicans,, migratory whales, flamingos, Puma, foxes, alpacas, vicunas, and condors.”(National Geographic Partners) The people speak Spanish. I want to help this country by building a vehicle factory. “Chile was first colonized by Spain but Simón Bolviar and José de San Martín deamed of South America free from outside control. Bolvíar fought in the northern part of South America but San Martín went to the south and led an army through the Andes mountains and took control over Chile” (Dennis Bollinger). “Today the country celebrates it’s independence day on 18 September 1810. The bicameral office is Chile’s court system. It consists of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies and the Supreme court which has a court president and twenty members”(South America: Chile). “Chile’s GDP or purchasing power is about 452.1 billion dollars in 2017. To compare the USA’s GDP is $19.49 trillion in 2017. Although USA GDP is ","forty-three times more than chile’s Chile’s economy compares pretty good to the USA because Chile is not as big a the USA . The USA has a population of 332,639,102 while Chile has a population of 18,186,770”(North America: United States). Chile has many resources. “It exports many agricultural items like grapes, apples, pears, onions, wheat, corn, oats, peaches, garlic, asparagus, beans, beef, poultry, wool, fish, timber, It exports many industrial resources like copper, lithium, other minerals, foodstuffs, fish processing, iron and steel, wood and wood products, transport equipment, cement, textiles copper, fruit, fish products, paper and pulp, chemicals and wine. Nine percent of the labor is in agriculture while twenty-three percent is for the industry”(South America: Chile). My factory use many resources for building automobiles like aluminum glass steel rubber. It will be very easy because there will be no language barrier because I speak spanish. Since the nation produces iron steel copper lithium and copper, I do not need to import the materials from other countries which help the country and make my automobiles cheaper to make. “For the poor will never cease from the land; therefore I command you, saying, You shall open your hand wide to your brother, to your poor and your needy, in your land” (New King James Version Deuteronomy 15:11). This verse inspired me to make cars because it will help the nations industry. ","Work Cited South America: Chile. https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ci.html .
