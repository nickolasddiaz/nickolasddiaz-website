["Diaz 1 Nickolas Diaz Miss Brit British Literature, Period 2 April 26, 2022 My view of Mere Christanity Lewis’s entire view of christanity can be summarized into one quote. “ the Christian thinks any good he does comes from the Christ Life inside him. He does not think God will love us because we are good, but that God will make us good because He loves us; just as the roof of a greenhouse does not attract the sun because it is bright, but becomes bright because the sun shines on it.”(Mere Christanity 36). This sums up how the christans life is. If a christan gets saved and thinks like this everything that Lewis will be natural and all add up. We should act like Christ did on earth . Lewis’s view of morality is that everyone is born with some sense of morality for example “able to point to some one impulse inside us which was always what we call \"good,\" always in agreement with the rule of right behavior” (Mere Christanity 14). The one thing the author missed out is that there are a lot of factors that can determine morality like circumstances and genetics. Take two people, the first one is given everything they want while the second one has to work for everything. The first one will act like a spoiled brat and the second one will be grateful for everything. On the other hand genetics can affect a lot more than realized. Person one has parents that have anger issues while person two has calm parents and both people have the same circumstances. Person one has anger issues while person two is calm. Is it fair for one person to have the wrong circumstances and genetics and go to hell forever. While someone with good circumstances and genetics go to heaven. Remember to keep in mind that women are more likely to be christans than men and wealth nations have less christans than third world countries. ","Diaz 2 Mere Christanity is perfect for someone who doesn’t know christ to a complete christan. Lewis has an interesting view on attracting non-christains to his book. In the beginning of his book, he doesn't talk about christanity, he focuses on all the controversial things about morality like do everyone has a morality why society views on morality. He draws everyone in to keep reading his book. While the reader is interested, he talks about why the reader should follow Christ and why every religion including evolution is wrong. In the last part of the book he goes into great depth to explain how a christain should act and think. Works Cited Lewis, C. S. Mere Christianity. Harper One, 2001. "]
