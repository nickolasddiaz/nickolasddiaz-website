["My decision in Christ first began in third grade as my Christianity came to maturity during several messages on Sunday mornings at La Palma Christian Church. The pastor who preached there intrigued me. His sermons all had one thing in common; they all started with singing and worship. Then the pastor would talk about a certain subject, for example, cheerful giving, the fruit of the spirit, tactics of the enemy, or a story from the Bible or about themselves. After the lesson, it ended with more worship, but what intrigued me was that the pastor’s lesson always ended with guiding the church to the Lord. My family enrolled my two brothers and myself in La Palma Christian Elementary School which further fuelled my love of God’s word. Having multiple speech problems since birth made it difficult to speak. This caused my confidence to go down because everyone but me could speak so effortlessly. However, God’s words were building me up day after day. One day my mom introduced me to Christ by praying the Lord’s Prayer, Mathew 6:9-13 with me. Jesus then became my trusted savior. During my high school years, my faith in Christ grew. In the summer of ninth grade, my baptism happened at the beach on La Palma Church baptism day. At the time, it happened in the water, the pastor talked to me and he dipped me in the water as my head came up out of the water, a great joy overcame me. One of my hardest years was as a junior in high school, yet God also provided blessings. Covid had stopped many things as a sophomore and then started them up all at once in the middle of my junior year. My soccer abilities were exceptional before Covid because of many hours and days dedicated to training. It was hard to stop and have to start over again, seeing that all my training places kept closing down. While my physical conditioning worsened, God gifted me in creating a downloadable online game that was downloaded 5,000 times on the first day to very thankful quarantined kids world wide. The game would come to bless 180,000 more to date ","and many fans created You Tubes explaining how to play the game in different languages. Also on a good ending is a big praise to God that my school was able to open again in my junior year although very restricted. My junior school year would become overwhelming just before second semester. Matters worsened when my Spanish III grades began dropping because of my language disability and due to a migraine attack the day before the first semester final, which got me a 69 percent on my final grade. Spanish had always been my weakness, even though my family was Hispanic and having always studied it more than any other class. The Covid ban on sports was lifted in late Feb 2021. My academy soccer, school soccer, and track practices were one after the other in the same season, making my days exhausting. School was 7am to 3pm, HS soccer practice was 3:30pm to 5pm and academy practice was from 6pm to 8pm. Playing 4 out of 5 week days and two academy games on the weekends caused me to study at every last moment off including all my lunch times mostly with my Spanish teacher. My faith in Christ allowed me to thrive throughout the tireless days and nights. The verse that kept me going was “So we don’t look at the troubles we can see now rather we fix our gaze on things that cannot be seen for the things we see now will soon be gone but the things we cannot see will last forever” (2 Corinthians 4:18) Biola University would be a great blessing in furthering my knowledge of God and would also help me be a blessing to others with this knowledge. Further benefits include close location, computer science and communication departments, and the opportunity to compete for a spot in the soccer and or track programs. ",""]
