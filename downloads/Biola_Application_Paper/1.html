<div class="text-container"><span id="t1_1" class="t s1_1">My decision in Christ first began in third grade as my Christianity came to maturity </span>
<span id="t2_1" class="t s1_1">during several messages on Sunday mornings at La Palma Christian Church. The pastor who </span>
<span id="t3_1" class="t s1_1">preached there intrigued me. His sermons all had one thing in common; they all started with </span>
<span id="t4_1" class="t s1_1">singing and worship. Then the pastor would talk about a certain subject, for example, cheerful </span>
<span id="t5_1" class="t s1_1">giving, the fruit of the spirit, tactics of the enemy, or a story from the Bible or about themselves. </span>
<span id="t6_1" class="t s1_1">After the lesson, it ended with more worship, but what intrigued me was that the pastor’s lesson </span>
<span id="t7_1" class="t s1_1">always ended with guiding the church to the Lord. My family enrolled my two brothers and </span>
<span id="t8_1" class="t s1_1">myself in La Palma Christian Elementary School which further fuelled my love of God’s word. </span>
<span id="t9_1" class="t s1_1">Having multiple speech problems since birth made it difficult to speak. This caused my </span>
<span id="ta_1" class="t s1_1">confidence to go down because everyone but me could speak so effortlessly. However, God’s </span>
<span id="tb_1" class="t s1_1">words were building me up day after day. </span>
<span id="tc_1" class="t s1_1">One day my mom introduced me to Christ by praying the Lord’s Prayer, Mathew 6:9-13 </span>
<span id="td_1" class="t s1_1">with me. Jesus then became my trusted savior. During my high school years, my faith in Christ </span>
<span id="te_1" class="t s1_1">grew. In the summer of ninth grade, my baptism happened at the beach on La Palma Church </span>
<span id="tf_1" class="t s1_1">baptism day. At the time, it happened in the water, the pastor talked to me and he dipped me in </span>
<span id="tg_1" class="t s1_1">the water as my head came up out of the water, a great joy overcame me. </span>
<span id="th_1" class="t s1_1">One of my hardest years was as a junior in high school, yet God also provided blessings. </span>
<span id="ti_1" class="t s1_1">Covid had stopped many things as a sophomore and then started them up all at once in the </span>
<span id="tj_1" class="t s1_1">middle of my junior year. My soccer abilities were exceptional before Covid because of many </span>
<span id="tk_1" class="t s1_1">hours and days dedicated to training. It was hard to stop and have to start over again, seeing that </span>
<span id="tl_1" class="t s1_1">all my training places kept closing down. While my physical conditioning worsened, God gifted </span>
<span id="tm_1" class="t s1_1">me in creating a downloadable online game that was downloaded 5,000 times on the first day to </span>
<span id="tn_1" class="t s1_1">very thankful quarantined kids world wide. The game would come to bless 180,000 more to date </span></div>
