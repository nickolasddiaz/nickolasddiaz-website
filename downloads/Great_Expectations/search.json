["Diaz 1 Nickolas Diaz Miss Brit British Literature per 2 April 8, 2022 Great Expectations is Gothic Charles Dickens implements many Gothic elements in his book Great Expectations. There are two good definitions of Gothic both that have different meanings. The first definition is “of or relating to an architectural style reflecting the influence of the medieval Gothic” (Webster) and the second definition is “a style of fiction characterized by the use of desolate or remote settings and macabre, mysterious, or violent incidents” (Webster). The story contains elements of Gothic buildings and Gothic mystery. Great Expectations has plenty of Gothic style housing. Many of the houses are described similarly like this. “Miss Havisham’s house which was of old brick and dismal and had a great many iron bars to it. Windows has been walled up”(Great Expectations). Gothic architecture at the time often looked poorly built and disgusting and felt aged. These houses fit perfectly into creepy gothic stories and display the creepiness of Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham herself is described as very Gothic. “Her shoes were white. And she had a long white veil dependent from her hair, and she had bridal flowers in her hair, but her hair was white”(Great Expectations). It is creepy to wear a wedding dress every day for the rest of her life. She is definitely very old because of her white hair. She is in fact demon possessed or has a mental illness. The Gothic story and architecture style is written all over the story and especially on Miss Havisham’s house and personality. The gothic style is very important to the story because of all of the suspense fear and supernaturalism.
