<span id="t2_1" class="t s1">Miss Britney </span>
<span id="t3_1" class="t s1">British Literature per 2 </span>
<span id="t4_1" class="t s1">December 7, 2021 </span>
<span id="t5_1" class="t s1">A Modest Proposal </span>
<span id="t6_1" class="t s1">Imagine being a student at Calvary Chapel High School and everyday having to buy </span>
<span id="t7_1" class="t s1">lunch. Only to be denied by the fifth period, robotics class in J127 which is incredibly far from </span>
<span id="t8_1" class="t s1">the lunch line. By the time the bell rings, most of the students from all the other classes are </span>
<span id="t9_1" class="t s1">already there, causing me to wait at least fifteen to twenty minutes of starvation to get food. This </span>
<span id="ta_1" class="t s1">is very annoying because waiting in line cuts into the forty-five minute lunch break. I am a senior </span>
<span id="tb_1" class="t s1">student at Calvary Chapel High school and I have been suffering under these long lines for three </span>
<span id="tc_1" class="t s1">years since I was a sophomore and have been waiting in these painful for years. </span>
<span id="td_1" class="t s1">This big problem can be easily fixed by changing how the food is served and paid for by </span>
<span id="te_1" class="t s1">the students. This will help the entire school, very much helps the drooling students who want to </span>
<span id="tf_1" class="t s1">get into the line first by pressuring the teachers to let them out early and running to the lunch line </span>
<span id="tg_1" class="t s1">like dogs. So the solution is to treat the students like dogs and put about one hundred to two </span>
<span id="th_1" class="t s1">hundred meals to serve on the wet dirty floor. It gives the student a lot more nutrients and </span>
<span id="ti_1" class="t s1">moisture if on the floor. Instead of not efficiently waiting in line, this way of serving will </span>
<span id="tj_1" class="t s1">completely remove the wait. This saves time for the lunch ladies since it saves them from serving </span>
<span id="tk_1" class="t s1">the student individually. Since the students are going to eat like dogs, plates and utensils will be </span>
<span id="tl_1" class="t s1">saved and will save the planet and money. The leftovers from the dogs will help make the school </span>
<span id="tm_1" class="t s1">more luxurious because the leftovers will stain the floor and make a cool pattern and it will give </span>
<span id="tn_1" class="t s1">the school a great smelling scent but might make everyone slip and fall. </span>
<span id="to_1" class="t s1">After the leftovers stain the cement it could be turned into a pool water, thus saving the </span>
<span id="tp_1" class="t s1">school lots of money. Just find a patch of grass, and dig a big hole and fill it with the leftovers. </span>
<span id="tq_1" class="t s1">The swim team will be very happy. The leftover dirt is very nutritious and good for the brain and </span>
<span id="tr_1" class="t s1">as well can be fed as an ingredient in the food. The most important reason is that it will make the </span>
<span id="ts_1" class="t s1">school very famous, because Calvary Chapel is not the only school with this problem, and the </span>
<span id="tt_1" class="t s1">solution will spread around the world over time. </span>
<span id="tu_1" class="t s2">The opposition might say that this is wasteful because the school will have to oversupply </span>
<span id="tv_1" class="t s2">and that the students do not have a chance to pay for the food. The solution to this is to </span>
<span id="tw_1" class="t s2">implement Dogcredits. The students will fill out a survey to see which days they want to eat so </span>
<span id="tx_1" class="t s2">that there is no oversupply. If the student forgets then they will be fed but in the reduction of their </span>
<span id="ty_1" class="t s2">Dogcredits. If it goes too low they will be punished. </span>
<span id="tz_1" class="t s1">Serving school lunch on the floor is the best way to go around. It saves lots of time, for </span>
<span id="t10_1" class="t s1">the students and the lunch ladies. It saves the school more money by creating a pool out of the </span>
<span id="t11_1" class="t s1">leftovers and makes the floor more luxurious and creates a great smell. Last of all the school will </span>
<span id="t12_1" class="t s1">be famous and it makes the food more nutritious. </span></div>
