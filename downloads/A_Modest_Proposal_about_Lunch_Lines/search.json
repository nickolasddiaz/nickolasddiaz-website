["Nickolas Diaz Miss Britney British Literature per 2 December 7, 2021 A Modest Proposal Imagine being a student at Calvary Chapel High School and everyday having to buy lunch. Only to be denied by the fifth period, robotics class in J127 which is incredibly far from the lunch line. By the time the bell rings, most of the students from all the other classes are already there, causing me to wait at least fifteen to twenty minutes of starvation to get food. This is very annoying because waiting in line cuts into the forty-five minute lunch break. I am a senior student at Calvary Chapel High school and I have been suffering under these long lines for three years since I was a sophomore and have been waiting in these painful for years. This big problem can be easily fixed by changing how the food is served and paid for by the students. This will help the entire school, very much helps the drooling students who want to get into the line first by pressuring the teachers to let them out early and running to the lunch line like dogs. So the solution is to treat the students like dogs and put about one hundred to two hundred meals to serve on the wet dirty floor. It gives the student a lot more nutrients and moisture if on the floor. Instead of not efficiently waiting in line, this way of serving will completely remove the wait. This saves time for the lunch ladies since it saves them from serving the student individually. Since the students are going to eat like dogs, plates and utensils will be saved and will save the planet and money. The leftovers from the dogs will help make the school more luxurious because the leftovers will stain the floor and make a cool pattern and it will give the school a great smelling scent but might make everyone slip and fall. After the leftovers stain the cement it could be turned into a pool water, thus saving the school lots of money. Just find a patch of grass, and dig a big hole and fill it with the leftovers. The swim team will be very happy. The leftover dirt is very nutritious and good for the brain and as well can be fed as an ingredient in the food. The most important reason is that it will make the school very famous, because Calvary Chapel is not the only school with this problem, and the solution will spread around the world over time. The opposition might say that this is wasteful because the school will have to oversupply and that the students do not have a chance to pay for the food. The solution to this is to implement Dogcredits. The students will fill out a survey to see which days they want to eat so that there is no oversupply. If the student forgets then they will be fed but in the reduction of their Dogcredits. If it goes too low they will be punished. Serving school lunch on the floor is the best way to go around. It saves lots of time, for the students and the lunch ladies. It saves the school more money by creating a pool out of the leftovers and makes the floor more luxurious and creates a great smell. Last of all the school will be famous and it makes the food more nutritious. "]
