<span id="t3_4" class="t s1_4">police would be needed in the future. In the end, businesses would lose money. Criminals who </span>
<span id="t4_4" class="t s1_4">are caught must go to trial and are kept in prison, and as a result, contribute less to society. All </span>
<span id="t5_4" class="t s1_4">these things add up making crime very costly to stop, judge and store. </span>
<span id="t6_4" class="t s1_4">Raising the minimum wage may seem like a good idea, but there are some negative </span>
<span id="t7_4" class="t s1_4">consequences associated with it, like joblessness. The higher a worker is being paid the less </span>
<span id="t8_4" class="t s1_4">money the employer will make. By raising their salary, the employee could put fewer workers on </span>
<span id="t9_4" class="t s1_4">the payroll to keep the same profit. According to the American Exchange Counsel, “if the </span>
<span id="ta_4" class="t s1_4">minimum wage was $10, it would result in about 500,000 fewer workers employed. But 900,000 </span>
<span id="tb_4" class="t s1_4">more people would be able to escape poverty.” Increasing the minimum wage would result in </span>
<span id="tc_4" class="t s1_4">more pay but in turn more unemployment. For this reason, many employers would prefer to hire </span>
<span id="td_4" class="t s1_4">lower-level employees as they would like to cut costs. Many practices are already happening </span>
<span id="te_4" class="t s1_4">such as overworking current employees and outsourcing to other countries with lower wages. </span>
<span id="tf_4" class="t s1_4">Some employers are even replacing workers with machines and artificial intelligence. </span>
<span id="tg_4" class="t s1_4">Customers will also receive the price for the wage increase. As many products produced by </span>
<span id="th_4" class="t s1_4">minimum wage will increase. “It is estimated that raising wages to $15 to $22 per hour would </span>
<span id="ti_4" class="t s1_4">result in a 25 percent increase in prices” (Purdue University). To raise the prices of their </span>
<span id="tj_4" class="t s1_4">products, companies need to keep their profits at a normal level. Yet, companies cannot raise it </span>
<span id="tk_4" class="t s1_4">too high as they will not be able to sell. So they will have to compete with other companies for </span>
<span id="tl_4" class="t s1_4">their prices. The reason that minimum wage workers are paid so little is that they are in very </span>
<span id="tm_4" class="t s1_4">little demand. A wage increase at the lowest skill level cannot justify a wage increase at the </span>
<span id="tn_4" class="t s1_4">highest skill level. As a result, the employees who are skilled in their work will get the pay </span>
<span id="to_4" class="t s1_4">increases they deserve. While the employees who work the least will lose their jobs. This is good </span>
<span id="tp_4" class="t s1_4">for the people who stay because it will allow them to stay to afford a good living. Not good for </span></div>
