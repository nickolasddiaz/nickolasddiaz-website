<span id="t3_3" class="t s1_3">Raising the minimum wage won’t affect low-wage workers. It will also increase the </span>

<span id="t6_3" class="t s1_3">GDP of around $80 billion” (Economic Policy Institute). This is because it is more likely for </span>
<span id="t7_3" class="t s1_3">low-wage workers to spend extra earned income over high-paid workers to spend more earned </span>
<span id="t8_3" class="t s1_3">income. After all, low-wage workers are more likely to spend a large percentage of their income </span>

<span id="ta_3" class="t s1_3">high salaries, from corporations, are more likely to save their surplus earnings. People who are </span>
<span id="tb_3" class="t s1_3">better paid are more likely to spend their money on businesses and increase the economy. The </span>

<span id="tg_3" class="t s1_3">Medicare and other programs.” Having a lower tax rate would allow the US government to cut </span>
<span id="th_3" class="t s1_3">back on taxes. As a result, spending more money on other programs would be very beneficial. </span>

<span id="tl_3" class="t s1_3">Research). The main reason why people cause crimes is because of how unaffordable living is. </span>
<span id="tm_3" class="t s1_3">Low-wage workers often feel that they have nothing to lose and commit crimes to keep </span>
<span id="tn_3" class="t s1_3">themselves afloat. If they had more money they would not have a reason to do so as they </span>
