["Diaz 1 Nickolas Diaz Miss Brokate World History Period 1 16 December 2019 Leonidas persuading the Spartans to hold the Pass at Thermopylae I am Leonidas, king of Sparta. I have trained to be a hoplite warrior since I was a child. Now as king, the people of Sparta are under the threat of the powerful Persian empire. If we hold the pass of Thermopylae, we can stop Xerxes from destroying Sparta and selling us to slavery. Thermopylae is the easiest strongpoint for our army to defend Persia. Thermopylae is a narrow pass on the east coast of Greece with two checkpoints. The perks of Thermopylae is that Xerxes can’t go around it and he has to go through it but he can only attack with a few solders at a time. With our skilled army they can definitely deal with only part the army at once. The Spartan army has a round shield in front of the formation giving protection to the warriors behind it allowing them to attack, easily countering the enemy. However if the formation breaks, it can become easily countered. With our experienced army and the strongpoint, the Persians will be defeated. The pass of Thermopylae could help us turn the tables around. Sparta has been on the losing side of the war and we have lost a lot of our army. ","Sadly we were not able to stop the Persians in four out of the five clashes. The overwhelming Persian army has over one hundred Diaz 2 thousand soldiers. While the Spartan army has only seven thousand soldiers. Many city-states have betrayed us and already joined Xerxes and some of the city-states had became neutral. While the rest of the city-states are on our side. Defending the pass of Thermopylae will be our only hope to defeating the Persians. Before invading our lands, the Persian king Xerxes implored me to surrender my arms but I replied to come and take them. We will not be like the city-states which surrendered to the Persians. The spartan people was trained since childhood to never surrender. Come back with your shield or on it was said by Spartan mothers as they sent their sons to battle. It means either you will win the battle or you will die and be carried back by your shield. Just like we are going to do at the pass of Thermopylae. If we surrender to the Persians, they will still destroy the city and sell us into slavery. People of Sparta, defending the pass of Thermopylae is the best plan because Thermopylae is a narrow pass which is an easily defendable battlefield. We are extremely desperate for a victory against the Persians because they have an overwhelming force and that surrendering to the Persians because the Persians will not treat us kindly. If we don’t defend ","Thermopylae, not only the Persians will destroy our army, they will burn the city to the ground and sell us into slavery, most importantly the gods, Athena and Apollo will not be happy with our defeat and we will live in pain in the afterlife forever. However if we defend Thermopylae we, will defeat the Persian forces and Athena and Apollo will bless us. "]
