["The African Americans were forced from their homes and families and put on crowded ships and they were sold as slaves to places they never heard of. As slaves, they would never see their families or home again and many of them worked for the rest of their lives in unbearable conditions. The ships were super crowded so much so that they couldnâ€™t even turn around. The sailors only saw the Africans as money, nothing else. They didn't care if they were children, suffered immeasurable pain, starved or even died. In fact I have been on one of those ships as a slave trader and I remember when the sailors caught a huge amount of fish and they ate their shair of fish and they had lots of leftovers but the crew members threw the leftovers overboard and didn't even think about the starving Africans. Everyday on the ship I felt miserable every time I heard constant growling, screaming and crying people. When I went on the bottom deck of the ship where the Africans were kept, I saw many diseased and dead people. When the trip was over I quit my job and ever since I opposed the slave trade. "]
