<span id="t3_5" class="t s1_5">available at the time. The job gave her a prospect on black-white relations,” (Gale Literature: </span>
<span id="t4_5" class="t s1_5">Contemporary Authors). Toni Morrison worked for many people and many of them were racist. </span>
<span id="t5_5" class="t s1_5">This especially helped give her writing an edge because most of her novels and poems promoted </span>
<span id="t6_5" class="t s1_5">the Civil Rights Movement. </span>
<span id="t7_5" class="t s1_5">The setting of The Bluest Eye is a racist community where whites discriminate against </span>
<span id="t8_5" class="t s1_5">blacks, “his mother didn’t like him to play around with blacks. She had explained to him the </span>
<span id="t9_5" class="t s1_5">distinction between colored people and whites,” (Als). Since the main character Pecola and her </span>
<span id="ta_5" class="t s1_5">family are black they are treated differently than whites. For example, whites and blacks are </span>
<span id="tb_5" class="t s1_5">always separated, some of these separations are schools, drinking fountains, and funerals but </span>
<span id="tc_5" class="t s1_5">most of the time whites get the better side. In the story, the blacks have to live with separation </span>
<span id="td_5" class="t s1_5">and racism. The Breedloves family was very poor. “The Breedloves lived in a storefront, they </span>
<span id="te_5" class="t s1_5">lived there because the family was black and poor,” (Als). The Breedloves were so impoverished </span>
<span id="tf_5" class="t s1_5">that they could not afford a regular apartment, they had to live in a storefront which is a room </span>
<span id="tg_5" class="t s1_5">above a store. </span>
<span id="th_5" class="t s1_5">Many of the characters in The Bluest Eye don't like Pelcoa, “who infringe Pecola in some </span>
<span id="ti_5" class="t s1_5">way or another,'' (Blake). Some examples of this are when Pelcoa’s mother left her family, when </span>
<span id="tj_5" class="t s1_5">her father raped her (while he was intoxicated thinking Pelcoa was his wife) impregnating her </span>
<span id="tk_5" class="t s1_5">and when her classmates who reject her and laugh at her. Lastly, the community rejected and </span>
<span id="tl_5" class="t s1_5">ignored her. Pecola is the main character in the Bluest Eye, but she doesn't get a good ending, </span>
<span id="tm_5" class="t s1_5">instead, she gets a horrific ending where she wants to be normal (in her diluted mind) and </span>
<span id="tn_5" class="t s1_5">because of it she wants to have the bluest eye thinking this would enable her to escape her </span>
<span id="to_5" class="t s1_5">persecution, “When we meet Pecola, she is eleven years old but already has lots of grief,” </span></div>
