<span id="t5_3" class="t s1_3">enraged at the 1941 Pearl Harbor attack and declared war on Japan.” (Spencer). It angered </span>
<span id="t6_3" class="t s1_3">Americans because Japan attacked the US without any warning even though they promised to </span>
<span id="t7_3" class="t s1_3">give a thirty-minute warning. This caused the Americans to be unprepared and therefore lost </span>
