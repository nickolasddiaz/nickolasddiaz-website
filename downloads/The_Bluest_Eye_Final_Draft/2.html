<span id="t3_2" class="t s1_2">were selling everything they could farm for a high price because there were lots of rations and </span>
<span id="t4_2" class="t s1_2">many people were drafted for the war. However, when World War I ended, the farmers could not </span>
<span id="t5_2" class="t s1_2">sell much, and therefore they lost a lot of money during the twenties. This means that they were </span>
<span id="t6_2" class="t s1_2">hit down even more by the depression. The farmers in the Central United States also did badly </span>
<span id="t7_2" class="t s1_2">during the Dust Bowl. The Dust Bowl started out in “1935 and America was hit with a dust </span>
<span id="t8_2" class="t s1_2">storm which affected farmers in the mid-US because they couldn't grow crops,” (Keese). It was </span>
<span id="t9_2" class="t s1_2">hard for the farmers to grow crops because all the dust storms would damage the crops. They </span>
<span id="ta_2" class="t s1_2">really only had five years to recover from the Depression and the farmers had always been doing </span>
<span id="tb_2" class="t s1_2">poorly. </span>
<span id="tc_2" class="t s1_2">The changes in the civil rights movement and the role of women had affected Toni </span>
<span id="td_2" class="t s1_2">Morrison significantly. The draft had called for “fifteen million men to answer the call to the war </span>
<span id="te_2" class="t s1_2">and the war increased the production of goods which means that it created a large demand of </span>
<span id="tf_2" class="t s1_2">workers and women filled those jobs,” (Hendrickson). Before World War II most men had jobs </span>
<span id="tg_2" class="t s1_2">and many women were housewives. During the war many men were enlisted to the military and </span>
<span id="th_2" class="t s1_2">there was more demand for goods and so women had to take over the jobs. In 1954 the Civil </span>
<span id="ti_2" class="t s1_2">Rights Movement started, “the Civil Rights Movement is about giving rights back to the blacks,” </span>
<span id="tj_2" class="t s1_2">(Hendrickson). Before the movement, the blacks were treated unfairly especially in the south and </span>
<span id="tk_2" class="t s1_2">there were separations of the whites and blacks out of everything, the military, schools, and </span>
<span id="tl_2" class="t s1_2">drinking fountains. The movement started with a “protest which started off with a bus boycott </span>
<span id="tm_2" class="t s1_2">about not giving up their seats to whites and Martin Luther King Jr led the movement,” (Keese). </span>
<span id="tn_2" class="t s1_2">The protest eventually grew over time, and it slowly changed the rights of blacks and the racism </span>
<span id="to_2" class="t s1_2">toward them. </span></div>
