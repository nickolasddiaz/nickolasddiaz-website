<span id="t3_6" class="t s1_6">(Blake). Pelican doesn't have a healthy sense of self, and she thinks very lowly of herself. She </span>
<span id="t4_6" class="t s1_6">thinks to have worth she must possess Blue Eyes. </span>
<span id="t5_6" class="t s1_6">There are many themes in The Bluest Eye, for example, that whiteness is superior to a </span>
<span id="t6_6" class="t s1_6">dark complexion, as depicted by the movies of the era, Sherly Temple was idealised for her blue </span>
<span id="t7_6" class="t s1_6">eyes. Pecola's mother preferred the white little girls she worked for rather than her own daughter, </span>
<span id="t8_6" class="t s1_6">whom she thought was ugly. Pecola’s desire to want the Bluest eyes thinking the cruel life she </span>
<span id="t9_6" class="t s1_6">has had to endure would be replaced by love and honor </span><span id="ta_6" class="t s1_6">. The want for being normal mixed with </span>
<span id="tb_6" class="t s1_6">her parent’s rejection and lastly, the community treating her badly, and unfairly. For Pecola, “her </span>
<span id="tc_6" class="t s1_6">desire for the bluest eyes is because of Pecola's dissatisfaction for who she is, with her world, </span>
<span id="td_6" class="t s1_6">and of her want for something greater,” (de Weever). Her want for Blue Eyes made her go insane </span>
<span id="te_6" class="t s1_6">and thinks that she has blue eyes. The first example that she wanted blue eyes was when she </span>
<span id="tf_6" class="t s1_6">prayed to God about it every day. Another reason she wanted blue eyes is that in her mind she </span>
<span id="tg_6" class="t s1_6">thought that the bluest eye is the most beautiful thing in the world, and it would solve all her </span>
<span id="th_6" class="t s1_6">suffering and problems. Another theme is the rejection of both of her parents for his dad who </span>
<span id="ti_6" class="t s1_6">raped her daughter, “which, at twelve years old, she has no option to provide for herself,” </span>
<span id="tj_6" class="t s1_6">(Booklist). </span><span id="tk_6" class="t s1_6">Her dad didn't love her because it is a horrible thing to do. The dad had to take care </span>
<span id="tl_6" class="t s1_6">of her because she is a minor, and it is the law that the parents have to take care of her, which </span>
<span id="tm_6" class="t s1_6">means she would live on her own when she turned eighteen. As for her mom, she just left the </span>
<span id="tn_6" class="t s1_6">whole family. She didn’t care about her daughter, if anything happened to Peleca there would be </span>
<span id="to_6" class="t s1_6">no consequences for the mom. The last theme is the rasism and discrimination,“The Bluest Eye </span>
<span id="tp_6" class="t s1_6">amplifies an extreme form of the shame-anxiety and shame-vulnerability of African Americans </span>
<span id="tq_6" class="t s1_6">in America,”(Als). Throughout the book Pecola is judged differently just because she is black, </span>
