["My decision in Christ first began in third grade. Although I had been raised in a christian home all my life, I came to maturity after I had listened to several messages on Sunday mornings at La Palma Christian Church. The Pastor who preached there intrigued me. His summons all had one thing in common, they all started with singing and worship and then the pastor would talk about a certain subject for example cheerful giving, the fruit of the spirit, tactics of the enemy, or a story from the bible or about themselves. After the lesson, they ended off with more worshiping, but what intrigued me was that the pastor’s lesson always ended with guiding the church to believe and repent in God. As time went on, my interest in Christ increased. My 2 brothers and I started going to the La Palma Christian elementary school there, which further fueled my love of God's word and the peace I received with those words.. Having had a several speech problem since birth (the worst being my vocal cords not maturing til almost 13 years old) well I could barely speak.This caused my confidence to go down as I could see how everyone else could speak so effortlessly, But I could hear God's words building me up every time I listen to them. One day my mom introduced me to Christ by praying the Lord’s prayer (Mathew 6:9- 13)with me and I accepted Jesus as my savior. During my high school years, my faith in Christ grew. I was baptised in the summer of ninth grade, at the beach on La Palma Church baptism day. At the time it happened in the water, the pastor talked to me and he dipped me in the water. I came out very different. One of the hardest years in my high school was my Sophomore-Junior year yet God also provided blessings. Covid stopped many things (the hard part) and then started them up all at once (the overwhelming part). I was an advanced athlete before covid because of mega ","hours/days dedicated to training. It was hard to just stop and have to start over again seeing that all my training places kept closing down. A big praise to God that my school was able to open again in my jr year, but although very restricted. While I was losing my conditioning, God gifted me in creating a downloadable online game that was downloaded by 5 tho quarantine kids on the first day. The game would come to bless 50 tho more to date and create worldwide u tubes in different languages on how to use it. My Jr. school year would become overwhelming in the 2 semesters. To make matters worse I had taken an davance Spanish 3 class (not good since I was still overcoming my languish disability) I had a severe migraine attack the day before the Spanish 1st semester final and ended up -2 points from a C- ouch! Spanish was like taking 3 classes in workload and caused me to have less time for my other classes. The covid ban on sports was lifted in late Feb 21, My club soccer and school soccer/Track practices were one after the other. Making my school life on edge from: (seven to three school).(soccer practice three-thirty to five).(club practice six to eight) Then School Games usually 4 days a week and mostly 2 or 3 club games Sat, Sunday with 1 hr drive and studying every min. My faith in Christ allowed me to thrive throughout the tireless days and nights. The verse I've learned to keep in my head when things don’t go as expected is, “So we don't look at the troubles we can see now rather we fix our gaze on things that cannot be seen for the things we see now will soon be gone but the things we cannot see will last forever ” (2 Corinthians 4:18) Biola University would be a great blessing in furthering my knowledge of God and would also help me to be a blessing to others with this knowledge. Further benefits include: close ","location, computer science and communication departments, and the opportunity to compete for a spot in the soccer and or track programs. "]
