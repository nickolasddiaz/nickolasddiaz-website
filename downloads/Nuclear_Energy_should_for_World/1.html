<div class="text-container"><span id="t1_1" class="t s1_1">According to Global Change Data Lab The world uses a whopping 160 trillion watts per hour as </span>
<span id="t2_1" class="t s1_1">of 2021. This number is so big it is fifteen digits long and it increases two percent every year as </span>
<span id="t3_1" class="t s1_1">there is an increase in the demand for energy across many countries due to the growing wealth </span>
<span id="t4_1" class="t s1_1">and population throughout the world. We can expect our global energy consumption to continue </span>
<span id="t5_1" class="t s1_1">to increase year after year unless we can offset this increased demand with improvements in </span>
<span id="t6_1" class="t s1_1">energy efficiency elsewhere. Our energy systems are increasingly dependent on fossil fuels for </span>
<span id="t7_1" class="t s1_1">energy, making the transition to low-carbon sources more challenging. An efficient energy </span>
<span id="t8_1" class="t s1_1">source should be able to meet this additional demand while displacing existing fossil fuels in the </span>
<span id="t9_1" class="t s1_1">energy mix. Nuclear energy would be the best fit for the future as it is the most powerful and </span>
<span id="ta_1" class="t s1_1">clean power source and It deserves to be the main power source in the future. Nuclear power is </span>
<span id="tb_1" class="t s1_1">ultimately powered by a reaction called fission According to the United State office of energy. </span>
<span id="tc_1" class="t s1_1">Nuclear fission is a reaction where a particle of a neutron is fired at an atom. When the particle </span>
<span id="td_1" class="t s1_1">strikes an atom, it splits the atom into two smaller ones and a few neutrons. These neutrons </span>
<span id="te_1" class="t s1_1">then hit other atoms starting the process again and again. As a result of the fissioning process, </span>
<span id="tf_1" class="t s1_1">a large amount of energy is released as heat. How can this reaction be used to create power? A </span>
<span id="tg_1" class="t s1_1">nuclear power plant works by supplying water to a reactor core, cooling it down which creates </span>
<span id="th_1" class="t s1_1">steam. The steam is used to turn a generator producing power to the power lines. Nuclear </span>
<span id="ti_1" class="t s1_1">power plants have a unique way of storing and getting rid of nuclear waste as it is a byproduct </span>
<span id="tj_1" class="t s1_1">of nuclear fission. The waste is first stored in submerged water where the radiation as water </span>
<span id="tk_1" class="t s1_1">shields the radiation from getting out to the world. Then the waste is covered in zirconium </span>
<span id="tl_1" class="t s1_1">encoding then stainless steel container helium and then concrete. This is to ensure no radiation </span>
<span id="tm_1" class="t s1_1">will ever escape even from disasters or terrorist attacks. Then the storage container will be </span>
<span id="tn_1" class="t s1_1">permanently stored underground in a mountain forever. The next big power source for the world </span>
<span id="to_1" class="t s1_1">has to be very safe. People often associate nuclear power plants with catastrophic disasters </span>
<span id="tp_1" class="t s1_1">and huge meltdowns releasing tons of radiation but that fear is completely wrong as nuclear </span>
<span id="tq_1" class="t s1_1">power is way safer that any other source out there. Even when nuclear power becomes </span>
<span id="tr_1" class="t s1_1">disastrous it is not as bad as you may think. According to the world nuclear association, there </span>
<span id="ts_1" class="t s1_1">have been only two nuclear power plant disasters from the 1960s to today. One was Three Man </span>
<span id="tt_1" class="t s1_1">Island where there was severe damage to the reactor, but the radiation was contained and not </span>
<span id="tu_1" class="t s1_1">spread to the outside and there was no one injured and no damage to the environment. In </span>
<span id="tv_1" class="t s1_1">Chernobyl there a steam explosion and fire destroyed the reactor, which initially killed two </span>
<span id="tw_1" class="t s1_1">people along with 28 more who contracted radiation poisoning and there was some damage to </span>
<span id="tx_1" class="t s1_1">the environment. The nuclear industry has learned from these two mistakes and the chance of </span>
<span id="ty_1" class="t s1_1">this happening again is nonexistent. From the time nuclear power came out only 30 people have </span>
<span id="tz_1" class="t s1_1">been hurt or killed because of it. That is almost nothing compared to many other energy sources </span>
<span id="t10_1" class="t s1_1">in the world. Permanent storage of nuclear waste is also feared even though it is extremely </span>
<span id="t11_1" class="t s1_1">safe. According to the United States Nuclear Energy Institute In spite of what the U.S. nuclear </span>
<span id="t12_1" class="t s1_1">industry has created since the 1950s, all of its waste is safely contained and takes up very little </span>
<span id="t13_1" class="t s1_1">space. Nuclear plants produce enormous amounts of energy with very few byproducts due to </span>
<span id="t14_1" class="t s1_1">the energy density of nuclear fuel. As a matter of fact, the total amount of waste produced in the </span>
<span id="t15_1" class="t s1_1">United States would fill an entire football field, 10 yards deep. Nuclear power has generated as </span>
<span id="t16_1" class="t s1_1">much waste by volume throughout its history as a coal plant generates in an hour. This is </span>
<span id="t17_1" class="t s1_1">almost nothing compared to every other energy source. Even if the waste was not sealed, </span>
<span id="t18_1" class="t s1_1">Almost all nuclear waste is not very radioactive and has been responsibly disposed of, for many </span></div>
