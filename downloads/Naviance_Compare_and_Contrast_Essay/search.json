["Diaz 1 Nickolas Diaz Mrs.Karkut American Literature per 2 November 11 2020 Compare and Contrast Game Designers and Security Analysis My two careers that interest me are game designers and information security analisis. A game designer is creating or updating a video game while an information security analyst is like a hacker but makes a business or corporation more secure against other bad hackers. Although they are great jobs to work at, one is better than the other. A job in game design requires people to create features in a video game, implement role play and stories. The job also requires collaboration with other workers to produce a game. The skills and knowledge needed for a game designer is an artistic, marketing ability and managing a schedule. The five most important skills are programming, listening to others, reading comprehension, problem solving and critical thinking. The five most important abilities are originality, having ideas, near vision, speaking and reading. In California the average person working the job makes 98,460 dollars in a year and for the hour is 47.34 dollars. For the top ten percent is 158,230 dollars per year and for the hour 47.34 dollars. Some common tasks for being a game designer are balancing the game so everything in it is fair, providing feedback from game developer to developer, creating two or three dimensional models, and creating story challenge missions in the game. Some common work activities are building a team creating cooperation, trust and respect, working to long term objectives and completing them in time and calculating, coding, verifying data and organising. I couldn’t find the type of education needed for a game designer. I picked Azusa pacific University for my ","Diaz 2 college because they have a lot of majors for computer sciences but I might not apply there because I don’t know much about the college and secondly I don’t know what education I need to be a graphic designer. For the GPA to enter the college, I need a 3.6. For the SAT I would need a 1117 and lastly for the ACT it is not available or needed. For the road trip video I picked Raza Ahnad and his perspective is all about working hard, persevering and having some amount of luck. He also talks about finding close friends or family members to believe in you and to commit to my dream or vision no matter how hard the hardship is and lastly to learn from my hardships and mistakes. I learned from Raza because he rejected being a doctor even though his dad was one. For me, my dad wanted me to be a doctor, but my passion is to be a game designer instead. Another person relating to my field is Maria Burns Ortiz, who is the creator of 7 generation games. I learned that she decided to quit her job and go to a different job which she had a passion for. The next job is an information security analyst, which upgrades the security of computer networks and they will protect digital files and they may help with viruses and security breaches. The interests for this field are conventional, working with ideas, and realistic. The five most important skills are reading, critical thinking, writing, speaking and problem solving. The five most important abilities are oral and written understanding, inductive and deductive reasoning and problem sensitivity. The five knowledge areas are the use of computers, communication, managing time, the english language and education and training. I am not sure what the employment outlook is for a security analysis. For the wages for an average Californian for the year is 108,090 dollars and for the hour is 51.97. Some of the typical tasks in the job are developing a way to protect a file from being manipulated, destroyed or copied, try to hack through data transmissions and firewalls to prevent other hackers from compromising the ","Diaz 3 company, and to train others about the dangers and how to prevent potential attacks. The common work activities are monitoring the surroundings of a place so that no one can go inside a place, inspecting equipment to know if there is anything broken or needs to be updated, keeping track of the money or resources a company has so that nothing gets stolen, and to build trust, team members and cooperation. I am not sure of what education is needed for being a security analyst. The college that I picked is Biola University, I picked it because it has some majors on computers but I am not sure I will go there because I don’t know what degree I need to be a security analyst and I do not know much about the college. The GPA I need for this college is 3.48 and for the SAT I need 1085 and lastly for the ACT I need a 24. For the road trip, I picked Alex Harmon and he is a senior security analyst working for microsoft. His perspective is to love the job he is in and to compete with others and he learned the hard way to keep a balance between his life and his job. He also values teamwork and collaboration. One thing I learned from him is to never give up even if I am struggling, Alex struggled through school but he kept on persisting. Another thing I learned about him is that being too prideful in a team can bring the entire team down and having that characteristic can make anyone lose a job. Another road trip video is about Dianna Graham Dudas, she is senior cybersecurity assurance analyst at SunTrust. Her perspective or motive is that she used the pains in her life, like a broken home and poverty and turned it into good. Since she couldn’t pay for college she applied to the military and got her degree for free. What I learned from her is that she didn’t know what to do after high school so that shows me that it is not too late to follow my dreams. Diaz 4 ","To end it off, the game designer job is my first choice rather than the information security analysis. One reason for this is that the game designer is more interesting, it is more interesting to create a game than figuring out a way to break in a computer system. A big reason is that a game designer relies less on communication than information analysis which is my biggest weakness. However information security analysis will still be a great job and a great second choice. Two reasons for this is because both of the jobs have very similar high pays. For the game design it is 98,460 per year while information security analysis is 108,090 and another reason is that they both are very similar if in the long term I don't like game design and commit to security analysis the path is already ahead of me.
