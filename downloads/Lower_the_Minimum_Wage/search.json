["Diaz 1 Nickolas Diaz Mrs Karkut American Literature per two 7 January 2021 California Labor Code Section 510 The major issue or law that we are trying to resist is the California Labor Code section 510 which is the minimum wage law in California. Right now the minimum wage is 14 dollars an hour for 24 or less employees and for 15 dollars for more than 25 employees. This is a huge problem for the economy because the more the employees get paid the less money all the businesses earn. In order to keep their regular profits, the businesses will have to increase their prices or will have to fire employees or give them less time to work. I am choosing to protest with some restaurant workers who want to hold signs in a park or street. This protest won't be that big because there are no organisations formed who protest this kind of law. One negative effect of protesting this is that there is an organization called fight for fifteen which most of the US citizens are protesting for. A positive effect is that it will raily up more people who want to lower the wage. My family is sold on the idea of the protest and they are eager to join in on the protest. Their motivation for this is that lowering the wage will help the businesses and lower the prices of the groceries. They are also doing this because they want me to have a better future in life. The protest was scheduled to arrive at a crowded park and would start at twelve in the morning and would end at ten at night, so it was about ten hours of protesting. When we arrived ","Diaz 2 at the protest there were seven people before us, making the protest have thirteen people. During the protest, the crowd was holding four signs. One sign stated the lower the minimum wage, the better the economy will be. The second sign stated if the minimum wage increases, the more we are going to pay for fast food. The third and fourth sign said the same thing, lower the minimum wage. During the protest many people saw and passed through the protest, many people, mostly low class people disliked the idea of lowering the minimum wage, while a few people mostly upper class, praised us for protesting, saying that lowering the wage is the right thing to do. As the time went on, the more tired and weary we were, but we kept on perstiting and enduring. At seven-twenty everyone was very hungry, so we all took a half an hour break to eat. As planned the protest ended at ten in the night and we all went back home. In the end the protest we did got on the local news, but many people didn’t really care about the protest. Even though some people we got noticed, our efforts seemed fruitless because the law wasn't changed and no one was talking about it. Although it seemed fruitless, we kept on persisting and doing the protest again and again and the restaurant workers protested by not taking their pay. As time went on,more people came to protest and many people’s minds got changed. Eventually the laws got changed for the better. If I were given the chance I would no doubt do it again.
