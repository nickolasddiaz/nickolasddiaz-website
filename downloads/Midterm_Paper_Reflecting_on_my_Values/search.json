["Diaz 1 Nickolas Diaz Jeannie Mitsch COUN 151 C April 1, 2023 Personality Midterm Paper Values, Interests, Strengths, Skills, and Personality Preferences are among the many things that people don’t pay attention to or care about at all. Their importance cannot be overstated, especially if you want to know yourself better. Knowing yourself is essential throughout life as people make choices based on what they think they will like. For example, making friends, choosing a major, and getting a job. Among all of these, choosing a career that is not enjoyable is a crucial mistake billions of people commit. Being stuck in a boring and dreadful job all day all year is very dreadful. Online tests can be used to find out your values, interests, strengths, skills, and personality. For example, some famous ones are the “Strong Interest Inventory Assessment”, “MBTI Assessment”, and the “Myers-Briggs Type Indicator”. This essay will be about my experiences taking many of these tests and how accurate they are. A values test I did was the Human Values Test from idrlabs.com. This gave me a 40- question test asking me to rate on a scale of 6 for each question. In the end, accomplishment was the top value. This is true as my self-esteem is greatly impacted by how much I can accomplish and I strive to achieve more and more. My second value is security since I tend to think in terms of defense, offense, strengths, and weaknesses. However, a weakness of secure people is that they adapt to new changes and don't strive for change. The third value is universality which means tolerance, understanding, and appreciation of all scenarios and people. Universality is true for me as I tend to talk less and listen to others more. ","Diaz 2 Next is the interest test where I tested the Strong Interest Inventory Assessment test and got the Holland Code of CRI. This means conventional and realistic investigative. I think that the investigative interest is the truest of all three. As it resonates with questioning, analyzing, and problem-solving as well as a desire for order and structure. The second interest I have is realism as I tend to think with less emotion and more logically. When it comes to humor and happiness, I tend to be more serious. The last interest is conventional, where I prefer to step less outside boundaries and do things more in traditional ways. For example, I feel most comfortable in structured and organized settings and value stability, security, and a clear path to advancement for myself. The next test is the Strengths test where I used the Clifton Strengths Assessment and my top three values are harmony focus and command. For the command test, I feel that it is very untrue of me as I am often under others' command and do what others ask. However, I am very dependable and responsible for myself. The next one is harmony. As I don’t like conflict or drama I prefer to stay away from it. I also like peace and enjoyment. The last one is focused where I have an adequate deal of focus, but sometimes I get distracted a lot. The next test is skills. However, doing a test for this is not necessary as there are billions of different skills out there. My skills include coding languages C++, Python, Javascript, and HTML. I have lots of other cybersecurity skills as I have completed over 130 rooms on a website called tryhackme.com. This is a huge training ground for cybersecurity. I also play soccer and the 100 and 200-meter race. I was very proficient at both of them when I played them in high school. ","Diaz 3 The last test was personality preferences where I took the MBTI Assessment and got INTJ which means introverted intuitive thinking and judging. INTJ is accurate except for the judging part as I feel more perceptive. I tend to be more introverted as I am less social in the real world. I am more intuitive as I always think critically and realistically. I then found that most of the tests I did were very accurate. It shows me how I am and what I want to do in life. I think a security analyst job is suitable for me as I am investigative and I believe that critical thinking is crucial for the job. Having a good sense of accomplishment is crucial as security analysts have to work very hard to continue learning as the field changes constantly. "]
