["Diaz 1 Nickolas Diaz Miss. Brit British Literature per 2 March 17, 2022 If men viewed Pride and Prejudice Jane Austen wrote the novel Pride and Prejudice, from the viewpoint of a woman about marriage. But imagine if men were the perspective in the story, such as Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley, Mr. Wickham, and Mr. Collins. There are a lot of differences and unfairness to women's day to day, like meeting men, proposing marriage, and living in a partnership. For example, women have fewer rights than men, and they have fewer choices about marriage. Besides, they have to bear children, take care of the kids, and cannot go out. Women have fewer rights in the book than men, while men can get away with more from the story than women. For example, women can’t support themselves and thus need men to live. “The business of her life was to get her daughters married.” (chapter 1). The men in the story cared little about their partner’s happiness; as they are supporting their spouse. In the event they did not marry, their families would have to take care of them. As men could support themselves, they would not be under much pressure to marry. Under pressure, women could have their reputations tarnished. One wrong move could killed their chances of ever getting married as a family. When Lydia moved in with Wickham, this happened. “Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself.”(chapter 41). All the attention went to Lydia rather than Wickham. When this went off, the scandal could have damaged the family’s reputation and made the daughters unfit for marriage. In Wickham’s case, he would have dealt with little consequences. The rules were easier to break with men than with women. A woman’s role in marriage differs from that of ","Diaz 2 a man’s. Women have to stay at home, doing housework like cleaning, caring for children, and cooking. As a result, they rarely get outside at all. Men have more important jobs, such as working for money, maintaining and paying bills. “I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women” (Chapter 8). Women tend to not accomplish or aren’t doing great things. Life made it almost impossible for women to do anything other than housework. As men did not have to do inside work, they could focus on their careers, such as the military or getting rich through trade. Women and men differ in psychology. Society perceives men as better than women. Unlike men, there are restrictions in who they can speak to. For a woman to speak to a man, a family member must introduce her to that man. “It will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them” (Chapter 1). As described in the story, Mr. Bennet introduces Mr. Bingley to the five girls for Mr. Bingley to talk to his sons. Because, women are under more pressure to get married than men. Men are more likely to marry for love. It is hard, women to find the right type and a stable man. However, it is rare to find people that meet both requirements. “Happiness in marriage is a matter of chance” (chapter 6). If a man is rich enough, he can propose to any woman, and if she accepts, he has the upper hand. This is how society is. Most women preferred wealth to love. Women in this case would have to pretend to be in love with their partner. “a woman had better show more affection than she felt women had to do more to please” (chapter 6). Marriage is often an unpleasant experience for women, while men can enjoy more of the freedom and wealth they desire. Women were more likely to marry the wrong man. There is way too little time between meeting each other, dating, and becoming engaged. There is not enough time to learn about one another. “nor ever been so aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; ” ","Diaz 3 (chapter 42). A man and woman can meet and get married within a couple of months. To be dating, a couple must dance at least twice. Compared to today, it would take years and years of dating for a couple to ever be engaged. It is easy for women to fall into a disastrous marriage in such a short period, therefore why some modern couples split up. An example of this is when the Benet girls liked Wickham but realized he was an evil man, and love blinded the girls. “A woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all genuine affection for her.” (Chapter 42). Lydia and Wickham is a prime example of this. Wickham wanted to be in love with Lydia and leave her, making her homeless. Wickham had no interest in Lydia’s fate and did not care about her at all. If men were the perspective of Pride and Prejudice rather than women. The story would not focus on the pressures to marry. Men don’t need to marry to live; they have plenty of money from inheritance and jobs. Men also didn’t care about their partner’s happiness because they were supporting their spouse. Because they don’t have a tarnished reputation, they would be more reckless. Rather than focusing on women, the story would cover more about what men do, such as working, living in their houses, and leaving their families. The book would be less interesting because some marriages could be a lot shorter, like how Charlotte and Mr. Collins got married on day one. Marriage would be much happier for them because they look for the person they love and enjoy it because women can’t be manipulative because they don’t have many rights. To conclude, if the men wrote the book, it would not highlight as much of the flaws, uniqueness, irony, and struggles as the time.
