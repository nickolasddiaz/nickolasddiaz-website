["Diaz 1 Nickolas Diaz Miss Brit British Literature, Period 2 May 19, 2022 Mom’s Unfairness Imagine a unfair scenario where a detective solves a case where he find who did the murder. Yet instead of reporting the murder he lets it go scott free. This is exactly what happened in the ending of Murder on the Orient Express. Where the detective finds out the people who were murdered and decided to leave them and lie to the police. This scenario doesn’t compare to how unfair my story on how unfairly my mom is. I get great grades in school. I turn everything in, I do whatever my mom asks no hesitation and I always behave well. Yet I still get punished for the most arbitrary things. Many times she has asked me to help her outside to build, move or clean things. When I do it she complains, in one of three things. That I did not do a good enough job, that I did not do the job the right way or that she doesn’t like the way I do it. Then she responds with screaming of how I messed up and says “You're too addicted to the phone you are always unfocused. I am going to take your phone and computer and you're a failure and no one is going to hire you to do anything” Everything she says is wrong and she is the most ungrateful, lazy and rude inside the house or when guests are not around. Going out she is not rude and doesnt yell at anyone, she treats everyone outside the family with lots of respect. She is arrogant once she believes something is one way, she will not listen to anything except someone who is professional and is outside the family. Even then she gives them a hard time about how she is right. She is the one ","Diaz 2 hardest person to work for because she is arrogant, not smart, complains a lot, makes the work feel like hell and she cannot handle any criticism like this one. "]
