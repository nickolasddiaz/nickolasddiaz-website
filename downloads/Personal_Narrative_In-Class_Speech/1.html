<div class="text-container"><span id="t1_1" class="t s1">This is the story of how a 10-minute operation restored my full sight and saved me from a </span>
<span id="t2_1" class="t s1">lifetime of recurring severely painful migraine attacks. In the past, Iâ€™ve always suffered from eye </span>
<span id="t3_1" class="t s1">pain and have worn glasses since 4th grade. In laser eye surgery, a surgeon cuts a small part of </span>
<span id="t4_1" class="t s1">the eye open, corrects the vision with a precision laser, and then seals the wound within </span>
<span id="t5_1" class="t s1">seconds. </span>
<span id="t6_1" class="t s1">The specific place I went to is NVISION Eye Centers in Newport Beach, which is one of the best </span>
<span id="t7_1" class="t s1">in the state and had a surgeon who was one of the founders of this technology, with over 40 </span>
<span id="t8_1" class="t s1">years of experience. This was important because the surgery has some risks to it. If they fail, I </span>
<span id="t9_1" class="t s1">would have to have another surgery to fix it. Before the surgery, I had to come into their center </span>
<span id="ta_1" class="t s1">to check my vision. They used many instruments to do so. A week before the surgery, they </span>
<span id="tb_1" class="t s1">prescribed special eye drops that I had to put on every day. An hour before, I received </span>
<span id="tc_1" class="t s1">relaxation medicine to calm myself down. During the surgery, the surgeon cut my eye open </span>
<span id="td_1" class="t s1">while I was fully awake. It felt very weird. Next, my eye was lasered. I smelled and felt the </span>
<span id="te_1" class="t s1">burning of it. Then, the eye doctor sealed up the eye again with a laser. After proceeding to the </span>
<span id="tf_1" class="t s1">second eye, the surgery was done and I could immediately see 20/20 vision, however not for </span>
<span id="tg_1" class="t s1">long as I had to rest my eyes for the entire day in darkness. The doctors then gave me sleeping </span>
<span id="th_1" class="t s1">pills, and I slept for the entire day. For the first week after surgery, I had to wear protective </span>
<span id="ti_1" class="t s1">goggles. For the next two weeks, I had to wear dark shades. After that, I did not need any eye </span>
<span id="tj_1" class="t s1">protection and I could see 20/20 vision for the rest of my life. More importantly, this helped </span>
<span id="tk_1" class="t s1">significantly reduce my extreme migraine attacks. </span>
<span id="tl_1" class="t s1">In the end, the surgery was a great investment. Even though it cost 5,000 dollars. It saved me </span>
<span id="tm_1" class="t s1">from the cost of buying glasses, eye drops, and doctor appointments. The surgery center had </span>
<span id="tn_1" class="t s1">an awesome deal if somehow I lost my vision I would receive another surgery for free. I love </span>
<span id="to_1" class="t s1">20/20 vision because I hate wearing contacts and glasses. This has been the best investment of </span>
<span id="tp_1" class="t s1">my life. </span></div>
