["This is the story of how a 10-minute operation restored my full sight and saved me from a lifetime of recurring severely painful migraine attacks. In the past, Iâ€™ve always suffered from eye pain and have worn glasses since 4th grade. In laser eye surgery, a surgeon cuts a small part of the eye open, corrects the vision with a precision laser, and then seals the wound within seconds. The specific place I went to is NVISION Eye Centers in Newport Beach, which is one of the best in the state and had a surgeon who was one of the founders of this technology, with over 40 years of experience. This was important because the surgery has some risks to it. If they fail, I would have to have another surgery to fix it. Before the surgery, I had to come into their center to check my vision. They used many instruments to do so. A week before the surgery, they prescribed special eye drops that I had to put on every day. An hour before, I received relaxation medicine to calm myself down. During the surgery, the surgeon cut my eye open while I was fully awake. It felt very weird. Next, my eye was lasered. I smelled and felt the burning of it. Then, the eye doctor sealed up the eye again with a laser. After proceeding to the second eye, the surgery was done and I could immediately see 20/20 vision, however not for long as I had to rest my eyes for the entire day in darkness. The doctors then gave me sleeping pills, and I slept for the entire day. For the first week after surgery, I had to wear protective goggles. For the next two weeks, I had to wear dark shades. After that, I did not need any eye protection and I could see 20/20 vision for the rest of my life. More importantly, this helped significantly reduce my extreme migraine attacks. In the end, the surgery was a great investment. Even though it cost 5,000 dollars. It saved me from the cost of buying glasses, eye drops, and doctor appointments. The surgery center had an awesome deal if somehow I lost my vision I would receive another surgery for free. I love 20/20 vision because I hate wearing contacts and glasses. This has been the best investment of my life. "]
