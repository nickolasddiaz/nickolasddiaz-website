["Diaz 1 Nickolas Diaz Mr. Morphis Bible 12, Period 3 April 28, 2022 Agape and Eros Love in the bible There are lots of different types of love in the bible. In English there is only one word for love. For example the difference between the love of food and the love of God or family. The bible has multiple meanings for love written in a different language. The bible has four different versions of love. Eros for romance, Storage for family, Philia for brotherly and Agape for God. Learning the types of love is important because it helps us to learn the Bible better. The English version of love is bad. The only different love is by saying like, love and lots of love. Agape and Eros love are the most important in the bible. Agape love shows us how God wants marriage to be while Eros love shows us the right relationship with God and how to act like him. Eros is the healthy sexual atrrations or marrage between a husband and a wife. The word Eros is pronounced AIR -ohs and it came from a Greek word. Eros is not just the love between one man and a woman, it has to be biblical. Because of the sin of mankind Eros is distorted. People break the rules and sin causing lots of disturbances between marriages. This love is the second most important of all before Godly love. Eros love has lots of purpose, first of all procreation meaning having offspring and second it shows the glory of God. Last of all a couple may grow more in maturity of Christ. There are lots of rules between Eros or marriage. Respecting these rules will allow the partnership to live a Godly marriage. The most important of them all is to not have sex before marrage. This is important because if a couple breaks this rule then there might not be a chance ","Diaz 2 that the couple marries and then they become impure to the person that they are really marrying” (Learn Religion Eros). No one wants to marry a person of another sexualations with another person. This will weaken the true relationship with the other spouse. The second rule is to respect and enjoy each other. “Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous” (Hebrews 13:4). This is a no brainer. If the relationship doesnt respect and treat each other well then then the relationship will worsen and it will not be enjoyable. This definitely is not what God wants. The third rule of Eros love is about divorse. A couple cannot divorse for the wrong reasons. “I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery” (Matthew 19:9). The question is why can't a couple divorse because they don't like each other anymore or that one is abusive. It is because when a couple marries a person a couple makes a promise that they will be together forever until death. The last rule is that “Wives have to submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior'” (Ephesians 5:21-33). This might seem unfair but this is because the father has to lead the entire family as they tend to be the strongest physically and in society. Agape love is no doubt the most important type of love in the bible. Agape love is simply the most selfless, oblational, absolute love. Agape love “perfectly describes the kind of love Jesus Christ has for his Father and for his followers” (crosswalk.com). Jesus himself went to the earth and showed his unconditional love to everyone and made the ultimate sacrifice to save us from our sins. Jesus show christans an example of how they should live and love. Agage also comes from Greek origin and it is pronounced ah-GAH-pee. Agape love is the most important because it is the only way to be saved. Agape love is crucial to the christan faith. ","Diaz 3 There are many rules to Agape love, in order to have a loving relationship with God. The first one is that God’s love is perfect and he loves everyone. It doesn't matter what bad things people have done, nothing in the world good or bad will change God’s love. “God gives this love without condition, unreservedly to those who are undeserving and inferior to himself” (crosswalk.com). The second is that God is always going to want the best. Just like a parent he will put people through hard trials or harsh punishments in order to make people grow and mature. If God did not do this then everyone would be very evil and do everything they wanted to do and cause chaos. “Those people will be shocked to find themselves spending eternity in hell if they believe a loving God would not condemn anyone to hell.” (bible.org). It is a harsh reality but keep in mind that God is alway suffering with us. The third reason is that God's love is personal. “God’s love is an exercise of His goodness towards individual sinners” (bible.org). Having a relationship with God is personal. It is called prayer and it is very important to pray everyday and talk about anything. God’s love doesn’t just extend to talking, he can empower us to do more than we can do by ourselves. With the holy spirit we can do miracles, remove demons and compel us to fight our evil temptations. The last reason is that we have to make a great attempt to stop sinning. “Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show myself to them” (John 14:21). The reason why it is important is that the more we sin the farther we get from God. Reducing the amount of sin shows God that we are growing and trying to be more like him. It is also important to show others God’s love to us just like Jesus did on earth. “My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends” (John 15:12-13). This is the one ","Diaz 4 and greatest command that God gave to us. Treating others with love should come naturally as we grow as christans. To sum it all, Eros love is the love in a relationship with a couple with a man and a woman. Eros love has may rules including no sex before marage and do not cheat on anouther person, respect and honor each other and no wrongfull divorse and lastly husbands are the leader of the family. Agape love is the love of God in a relationship with God and a christan. Agape love also has many points, God is perfect and loves everyone and God wants the best and God's love is personal and the holy spirit empowers us and we should make an attempt to stop sinning.
