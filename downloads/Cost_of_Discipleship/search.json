["Diaz 1 Nickolas Diaz Mr. Morphis Bible 12, Period 3 May 16, 2022 Cost of Discipleship The passage is telling everyone about the hidden costs of being a Christain. Most people don’t consider how harsh the christain life is and might decide to pursue it only a certain amount. The passage recommends that anyone who wants to be a christain should consider the requirements first. The first requirement is that chirstains don't hate anything, like family members, their own life and other people. Hating things is the exact opposite of what God wants. The second requirement is that every christain has to carry their cross and follow me. This means that all christans have to sacrifice everything to follow christ. For some people who are only following Christ without everything they got, are completely in the wrong. The passage uses an analogy of a tower, ““Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won’t you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it? 29 For if you lay the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule you, 30 saying, ‘This person began to build and wasn’t able to finish.” Jesus does not allow for in between a christain and a nonbeliever. The verse Matthew 10:39 reminds me of this passage, “Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.” ","Diaz 2 "]
