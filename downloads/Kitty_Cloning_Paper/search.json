["1 Nickolas Diaz Miss Marano World Literature Period 3 21 November 2019 Kitty Cloning Paper The senator should vote for the bill to allow the U.S. to research both types, therapeutic and reproductive cloning because is ethical. Those who support cloning might say cloning a person copies their exact personality and memories, the environment, they live changes how they think and their personalities. For example “twins are a type of clone, they both have the same DNA makeup but they both have some differences in personality and how they think” (https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/cloning/whatiscloning/). Another reason the U.S. should research is because some breeds of cats are rare. “For example Jayne Lange has two Shiba Inu dogs but one of them are dead. He could clone one and get the same dog for his children” (24). Cloning could save extinct creatures like dinosaurs back to life just like the dogs. Researching cloning can bring new advancements or breakthroughs in the future. One of them could be “cloning an organ like skin or a kidney which can save a person’s life. The cloned organ could be used for other areas of research like cancer”(https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/genetic/cloned-organ- ","transplant.htm). The last reason cloning should be researched is because of family. Cloning a dog or a cat could carry on over a dead pet. “For example Tom Minot banked tissue from his dog so when his dog died, he can clone him” (27). Diaz 2 Work Cited Conor, Christen.
