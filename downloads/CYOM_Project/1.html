<span id="t6_1" class="t s1_1">Chad the Devourer </span>
<span id="t7_1" class="t s1_1">Once there was a very tall man named Chad, who had no life whatsoever. He hated </span>
<span id="t8_1" class="t s1_1">almost everything and was loved by no one. He lived in a small shack in the middle of the forest </span>
<span id="t9_1" class="t s1_1">that his grandfather once lived in. Next to the shack was a well which provided 100% of his </span>
<span id="ta_1" class="t s1_1">water. One dry day, the well dried up so his solution was to dig deeper to get more water. As he </span>
<span id="tb_1" class="t s1_1">started cleaning out the well, he lost his balance and fell in. When he fell, he felt a hand grab him </span>
<span id="tc_1" class="t s1_1">and shake him uncontrollably. This was no ordinary hand because this hand changed him. When </span>
<span id="td_1" class="t s1_1">he climbed out of the well, he noticed everything seemed different. He was suddenly very short </span>
<span id="te_1" class="t s1_1">and very confused. He looked to go inside the shack but when he turned and looked, he noticed </span>
<span id="tf_1" class="t s1_1">the shack was gone and in its place, a huge velvet mansion. </span>
<span id="tg_1" class="t s1_1">Perplexed by what had just happened, the man decided to walk into the mansion. As he </span>
<span id="th_1" class="t s1_1">got a closer look, he noticed that it was not only a mansion, but a gigantic castle! As soon as he </span>
<span id="ti_1" class="t s1_1">entered the courtyard, nightfall suddenly came, and a huge storm rolled in. He heard a loud, low, </span>
<span id="tj_1" class="t s1_1">rumbling sound, and realized that it was laughing! As he walked, he belt burdened, and realized </span>
<span id="tk_1" class="t s1_1">that he had fat, rounded feet, and a huge, plump body. He had big, thick ears. He no longer had </span>
<span id="tl_1" class="t s1_1">hair, but a strange, thick bar on his head. His arms, thin and slender, were higher on his body </span>
<span id="tm_1" class="t s1_1">than his one eye. As he walked in the castle, no one greeted him. He spent the night exploring, </span>
<span id="tn_1" class="t s1_1">and found many people trapped in the dungeons below. He was suddenly overcome by a hunger </span>
<span id="to_1" class="t s1_1">unlike any other, and he couldnâ€™t resist devouring the prisoners. </span></div>
