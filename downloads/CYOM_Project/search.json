["1 Diaz, Haughey, Koth, Ortiz, Sorensen Miss Brit World Literature Period 3 04 December 2019 Chad the Devourer Once there was a very tall man named Chad, who had no life whatsoever. He hated almost everything and was loved by no one. He lived in a small shack in the middle of the forest that his grandfather once lived in. Next to the shack was a well which provided 100% of his water. One dry day, the well dried up so his solution was to dig deeper to get more water. As he started cleaning out the well, he lost his balance and fell in. When he fell, he felt a hand grab him and shake him uncontrollably. This was no ordinary hand because this hand changed him. When he climbed out of the well, he noticed everything seemed different. He was suddenly very short and very confused. He looked to go inside the shack but when he turned and looked, he noticed the shack was gone and in its place, a huge velvet mansion. Perplexed by what had just happened, the man decided to walk into the mansion. As he got a closer look, he noticed that it was not only a mansion, but a gigantic castle! As soon as he entered the courtyard, nightfall suddenly came, and a huge storm rolled in. He heard a loud, low, rumbling sound, and realized that it was laughing! As he walked, he belt burdened, and realized that he had fat, rounded feet, and a huge, plump body. He had big, thick ears. He no longer had hair, but a strange, thick bar on his head. His arms, thin and slender, were higher on his body than his one eye. As he walked in the castle, no one greeted him. He spent the night exploring, and found many people trapped in the dungeons below. He was suddenly overcome by a hunger unlike any other, and he couldn’t resist devouring the prisoners. ","2 When he had eaten all of them he spent days setting traps around the land. The traps surrounded the castle, and he spent the next week stalking the forest. He searched and searched for anything that had a heartbeat. One day, as he was eating a group explorers that had fallen into his trap, he heard he heard a strange noise. The noise sounded like an approaching whinney. Curious of the sound, Chad went to investigate near the area, to see if he captured a horse. After a few minutes of searching, he got knocked to the ground out of the blue with a burst of wind. While on the ground, Chad was confronted by a ghost-like horse. The horse angrily yelled, “You deserve this for killing my friends!,” while crushing and killing him. "]
