["Diaz 1 Nickolas Diaz Miss Brit British Literature, Period 2 May 23, 2022 Armstrong Case Movie vs Real In murder on the oriental express, the story is based on the murder of the whole armstrong family of three, daisy the child John the father and Sonia the mother. Everyone in the train is either related, friends or employed by the Armstrong family. The Armstrong case is very similar to the Lindbergh kidnapping however the movie version is a lot more different than the real case. Plus the movie doesn’t go too much in depth into what happened in the case. In the movie version of the case, the baby, Daisy, gets kidnapped. Then the family received a huge ransom in order to have their baby back. The family pays the ransom but the family did not receive the baby. Later they found out that their baby has been murdered and the family is devistated. The killer then proceeds to kill the mother first then the father. In the end the killer is never found and the case is not solved. The real version hugely differs from the movie version. For starters the killer kidnapped the “baby and demanded ransom seven times from hidden notes and phone calls and every time the killer asked he increased the ransom. Starting from 50,000 to 70,000. The family tried to negotiate to try to bring the price down to 50,000. The family eventually did pay in check. However the a truck driver found the baby murdered”(fbu.gov). “Eventually the killer was found and his name was Bruno Richard Hauptmann and he was found because of a sketch of him. On February 13, 1935 Bruno was convicted of first degree murder and he was killed on anuary 17, 1936” (Wikipedia.org).
