["In the book The Whistler by John Grisham, one of the characters, Junior Mace is perceived as innocent, suffered and has no hope. He started out in the story happily living when in a flash her wife gets murdered by an unknown person and because of some anonymous corrupt people, he gets charged with the murder and everyone exept his family believes that he is the murderer. He is innocent because “[His] wife and son razko were murdered in1995. [Junior] was convicted in 1996 and taken away” (p49). He suffered because his family can’t even see him in prison and he lives in isolation for most of his life. “Now they are married. I'm even a grandfather, but I’ve never seen my grandkids” (p51). Lastly he has no future. He will live in solitary prison for the rest of his life until he gets sentenced to death. “Fifteen years of solitary eats away your soul” (p50). Von Dubose is guilty, lived his life and has a lost identity. He starts of in the story as a lost identity because he went to prison for murder then escaped prison then he had to change his name, home and identity. “Got a hit from your 1972 arrest for aggravated assault. Then you were Jack Henderson. You decided prison was not for you, so you pulled a pretty slick escape. Ditched the old name” (p354). Von Dubose is guilty for the murder of Juniors mace’s son and wife because he and his gang went against him. “Son Razko and his traditionalists won with 54 percent of the vote. Von Dubose was secretly funding the drive to approve the casino”(p32) Von also lived his life even though he went to prison at the end of the book. “Had 40 years of crime” (354). Both Junior Mace and Von Debose are similar, they were both involved in the casino and they are both in prison. Junior was against building the casino while Von was for it. “Son Razko [Junior's son] and his traditionalists won with 54 percent of the vote. Von Dubose was secretly funding the drive to approve the casino” (p32). Both of them are on death row for murders.“The freshly indicated defendants were placed in separate cells” (p353). “[Junior] was convicted in 1996 and taken away” (p49). ",""]
